Below we describe the necessary steps and specific settings of the analysis presented in methodology. The fist part consists of the description of the direct numerical simulations performed that are used as a numerical experiment, followed by details of the extraction of iso pressure surfaces and fluxes from which the hydraulic conductivity is calculated and integrated along consecutive pores. The second part gives the details involving the fitting exercise, including a detailed overview of the error ananalysis. In the third section we provide an overview of the parameter space in the form of a figure which includes histograms of relevant parameters. In the last part we take three samples from the three porous media to test the hypothesis that is made in Eq.() of the main article. 


\section{Direct numerical Simulations and extraction of pore attributes}

\subsection{Geometry of the porous media interface}
For all 3 media we have used a levelset of a Gaussian Random Field given by a spectral density as given in \cite{roberts_transport_1995} The level-set was chosen such that we have porosity values of $0.68,0.34$ and $0.16$, for porous media 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The geometries are represented by 3 stl files that serve as input for the build-in meshing algorithm of Openfoam v. 4.1 \citeA{weller_tensorial_1998}. The bounding box of the porous media (inlet, outlet, upper and lower wall, front and back) are obtained with a BlockMesh. The meshing of the pore space is obtained with SnappyHexMesh with refinement levels 2, for a minimum and 3 for a maximum at the porous media boundary. The number of cells are $35,~ 31,\rm{and}~15$ Million respectively.

We inlcuded Table \ref{tab:results_geometries} that show a few geometrical parameters characterizing the porous media. The averaged pore size is defined by $l_p = 4 \phi/s$ with $s= |\Gamma|/V$ the specific surface area given by the ratio of porous media interface total area $|\Gamma|$ and the total volume $V$. The surface roughness is defined by the standard deviation of the mean curvature $H$ divided by the average pore size $l_p$. These measures are introduced to show the wide range of chosen geometries. 

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\caption{Summary of the geometrical and fitting parameters, specific surface area $s$, relative pore size $l_p/L$, and the standard deviation of the mean curvature times the average pore size $\rm{std}(H)^{-1}/l_p$.}

- & porosity & $s$ & $ l_p/L$ &  $\rm{std}(H)^{-1}/l_p$ \\
\hline
PM1 &$0.68$ & $2.0\times10^{4}$ & $0.17$ &  $0.14$ \\
PM2 & $0.34$ & $1.8\times10^{4}$ & $0.08$ &  $0.44$ \\
PM3 & $0.17$ & $1.2\times10^{4}$ & $0.06$ &  $0.35$ 
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results_geometries}
\end{table}


\subsection{Direct Numerical Simulations}
The simululations are initialized with PotentialFoam and run with SimpleFoam with standard residual controls of $10^{-6}$ for both the pressure and velocity fields. The boundary conditions are defined at the inlet by $p_1 = 0$ and at the outlet by $p_2 = 10^{-3}$ and a no-slip for the porous media-fluid interface, and the upper and lower wall, as well as the front and back. The Kinematic viscosity is set to $10^{-6}\rm{m^2s^{-1}}$, which is close to the value for water. The SimpleFoam solver took approximately 20, 8 and 3 hours to obtain the results using 32 cores. A visualization of the results for the three porous media is shown in Fig.2 of te main manuscript.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Extraction of pores based on iso-pressure surfaces}
A chain of VTK-based image analysis techniques \citeA{schroeder_visualization_2006,hernderson_paraview_2007} is employed to extract iso-pressure surfaces. The analysis is scripted with pvpython which comes with the Topology ToolKit (TTK) installation for MACOS High Sierra (python 2.7.15, Paraview 5.4.1, TTK 0.9.3) \cite{tierny_topology_2018}. Specific Paraview/TTK filters are denoted with a capital letter. Values for parameters are given without units, but can be inferred from its definition. Note that the results of the simulation assign $p$ with the kinematic pressure, i.e. in units $\rm{m^2s^{-2}}$, from which the derive the static pressure by multiplication with the fluid density $p_s = p\rho_{f}$. The results in the paper are in correct units (using $\rm{Pa}$ for $p$), but in the following keep $p$ as the kinematic pressure. 

\noindent\textbf{Iso-pressure surfaces $\mathcal{S}(p)$ and noise removal}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-]The iso-pressure surfaces $\mathcal{S}(p)$ are obtained by taking a contour (Contour) filter on pressure value $p$ on the DNS data. For porous media 1 and 2 we have chosen $k$ iso-pressure surfaces $p_k = p_0+ k \delta p$ with $ \delta p= 5\times 10^{-6}$. Due to large heterogeneity in the pressure gradient in the third porous media we have chosen to double its resolution to $\delta p = 2.5\times 10^{-6}$. Due to the noisy edges, as described in the paper, we remove small area patches. This is done by segmenting $\mathcal{S}(p_k)$ with the Connectivity filter in $j\in \{1,M_k\}$ disconnected patches $\mathcal{S}_j(p_k)$ with total area $A_0(p_k)$. Each patch is isolated by a Threshold filter and its surface area $A_j(p_k)$ determined by an IntegrateVariables filter. A maximum value for $A_j(p_k)> A_{\rm{min}}$ is used to append (AppendGeometry) to construct $\mathcal{S}(p_k)$ with total area $A_{total}$ consisting of $N_k$ iso-pressure surface patches. The value  $A_{\rm{min}}$ is determined by a sensitivity study on the total remaining area $A_k$ and the number $N_k$ of remaining patches as a function of $ A_{\rm{min}}$. The threshold values are $A_{\rm{min}} = 3\times10^{-11}, 5\times10^{-11} $ and $2\times10^{-12}$ for the PM respectively and are determined from Fig.~ S2 showing $A_{\rm{total}}/A_0$ and $N/A_0$ as a function of $A_{\rm{min}}$ for three independent values of $p_k$. An example of $\mathcal{S}_i$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:segmentation} (left). The reduction of the total area has been at most $1.5\%$ for these three test iso-pressure surfaces.
	\item[-]For $i=0$ and $i=N$, the iso-pressures surfaces are flat. Since we deem this to be a finite size effect and in this case `unnatural' we allow the iso-pressure surfaces to develop over the first and last $10$ slices, defining $p_0$.
	\item[-]To repair some of the irregularities in the surface mesh we employ three more filters: Tetrahydralize, CleantoGrid, and an ExtractSurface.
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Segmentation of $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item[-]To segment $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ into $i\in{1,N_k}$ individual pores $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ a connectivity filter is applied (Connectivity, enumeration named `RegionId'), followed by a ExtractSurface and GenerateSurfaceNormals filter. An example of a segmentation is shown in Fig. S1 (middle).
	\item[-] For each $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ we calculate (Calculator) $\left|\mathbf{\nabla}U\right|$. To obtain the circularity $\mathcal{C}_i(p_k)$ we take a Contour on $\left|\mathbf{\nabla}U\right|=\epsilon = 10^{-9}~\rm{m/s}$, with $\epsilon$ about four orders of magnitude smaller than the averaged throughout the pore space. The obtained contour is subsequently integrated to obtain $\mathcal{L}_i(p_k)$.  
	\item[-] For each $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ we integrate (IntegrateVariables) the surface to extract the averaged position $\mathrm{X}_i(p_k)$, total flux $Q_i(p_k) = \int_{\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)}\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,da$, and total area $A_{i,j}= \int_{\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)}da$ and circularity $\mathcal{C}_i(p_k) = \mathcal{L}^2_i(p_k)/(4\pi A_i(p_k))$. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Local inheritance $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$}

Goal: For each $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ finding its closest neighbor $\mathcal{S}_j(p_k+\delta p)$.  
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-]]This neighboring iso-pressure patch (building up a pore) is found by calculating the distance function $f_d(\mathbf{x},\mathcal{S})$, between point $\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ and all iso-pressure patches $\mathcal{S}_l(p_k+dp)$. This distance function is calculated by the vtkDistancePolyDataFilter, a programmable vtk filter, and is defined by 
		\begin{equation}
			f_d\left(\mathbf{x},\mathcal{S}\right) = \min \{\Vert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\Vert \} ~|~ \mathbf{y}\in \mathcal{S}.
		\end{equation}
	for each $i,l$ we define the averaged distance matrix by using the IntegrateVariables filter
		\begin{equation}
			d_{i,l}(p_k) = \frac{1}{A_i(p_k)}\int_{\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)} f_d(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathcal{S}_l(p_k+\delta p)) \,dS_i.
		\end{equation}
	The closest neighbor $\mathcal{S}_j(p_k+\delta p)$ is found by the minimum value of $d_{i,j}(p_k) = \rm{min}\left\{ d_{i,l}(p_k)\right\}$. The closest neighbor is assigned by the identification number of the nearest neighbor $n_i(p_k) = j$ 
	\item[-] Subsequently we compute the change in surface area $dA_i(p_k) = A_i(p_k)-A_j(p_k+\delta p)$, the averaged location of the neighboring pore $\mathbf{X}^n_i(p_k) = \mathbf{X}_j(p_k+\delta p)$ and the distances between the two averaged coordinates $dX_i(p_k) = \left| \mathbf{X}_i(p_k)-\mathbf{X}_j(p_k+\delta p)\right|$. Last but not least we assign $dx_i(p_k) = d_{i,j}(p_k)$, which is used as $dx$ in the Eq. (10) and (12).
	\item[-] Now each patch $\mathcal{S}_i(p_k)$ has intrinsic attributes enlisted: $i, n_i, \mathbf{X}_i$, $Q_i$, $A_i$, $\mathcal{C}_i$. Additionally it has attributes that depend on its nearest neighbor $n_i$, $\mathbf{X}^n_i$, $dA_i$, $dx_i$ and $dX_i$. For all these attributes $p_k$ is implied. Additionally the intrinsic attributes of the nearest neighbor are logged. 
	\item[-] It is important to notice the difference between $dx_i$ and $dX_i$. The former is the averaged distance between two iso-pressure surface patches and therefore assigned to $dx$ wich stems from $dV = Adx$. The latter is the distance between the two averaged positions of the iso-pressure patches. 
	\item[-]Gathered all necessary pore attributes, we can use a least-squared fit of Eq.(9) to obtain $\alpha_i$ and Eq.(15) to obtain $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Defining pores by integration of local inheritance of $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the first iso-pressure patches $S_i(p_0)$ we initiate a pore identification number $P_i(p_k) = i$. 
	\item For each pore $i$ we integrate to the nearest neighbor $j$ by assigning the same pore number to $\mathcal{S}_{n_i}(p_0+\delta p)$ : $P_{n_i}(p_0+\delta p) = i$. This forward integration takes place only when five quality factors are fulfilled,
	\item $Q_1 = (|dX_i-dX_{n_i}|)/dX_i<q_1$: Ensuring that there is no abrupt change in consecutive averaged distances. 
	\item $Q_2 = |dA_i|/A_i<q_2$: Ensuring no abrupt changes in the surface area of consecutive area patches. 
	\item $Q_3 = (|Q_{0,j}-Q_{1,nn_{i,j}}|)/Q_{1,nn_{i,j}}<q_3$: Ensuring that the flux is `nearly' conserved.  
	\item $Q_4 = dX_i < q_4$: Ensuring that pores split if they are too far apart. 
	\item $Q_5 = A_i > q_5$: Removing `small' area patches. 
	The values are found by trial and error to decrease the number of pores but still capturing the merging and splitting of pores. For each quality factor we have 3 values tailored to each porous media 1,2 and 3 independently. For $q_1 = [1.6,.4,.4]$
, $q_2 = [.5,.5,1]$, $q_3 = [.2,.2,1]$, $q_4 = [10^{-5},10^{-5},9\times10^{-5}]$ and $q_5 = [1\times10^{-10},1\times10^{-10},5\times10^{-11}]$	These requirement seem quite loose, but have proven to be quite effective. 
	\item The assignment of pore numbers can continue iteratively until all patches have a pore identification number $P_i(p_k)$.	
	\item[-]For all $P_i$ we can calculate Eq.(12) and Eq.(15).
\end{itemize}



\section{Fitting models, Results and performance}
\subsection{Fitting models}
In the paper we have fitted three models $f_i$ to 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dp}{dx} = \frac{Q}{A^2} f_i
\end{equation}


\begin{eqnarray}
	f_1 = & \alpha_0+\alpha_1\mathcal{C} + \alpha_2 \frac{1}{A}\left|\frac{d A}{d x}\right|^2\\
	f_2 = & \beta_0+\beta_1\mathcal{C}\\
	f_3 = &1-\alpha\left[1-\mathcal{C}^{\beta}\right] 
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Performance}


\section{Measuring the relative Longitudinal and Transversal energy dissipation on an iso-pressure surface} 
In the theoretical section of the paper we have derived expressions for the longitudinal and transversal energy dissipation tensors, by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reduced_dissipation_tensor}
\left|\nabla_i u_j\right|^2 \approx  \left|\nabla_s u_p\right|^2 + \left|\nabla_n u_p\right|^2 .
\end{equation}
where we have assumed that the terms $ \left|\nabla_n u_n\right|^2$ and $ \left|\nabla_s u_n\right|^2$ are negligible. We will show two examples where we have calculated the individual terms of the total viscous dissipation. Because the highest dissipation is expected to be located near the porous media interface and the discretization also refined at the interface the numerical noise is also expected to be higher, see Fig\ref{fig:numerical noise}. All 3 porous media contain some points in the mesh where the VTK gradient filter can't factorize the linear system which leads to very high values of the respected fields. The origin lies likely in the mesh quality generated by the snappyHexMesh generator contained in the openFoam simulation. Since the simulations have all converged we do not question the original simulation results but we do note that post-processing of these meshes can be difficult especially if gradients have to be calculated. Nevertheless we have tried to quantify the relevance of the transversal and longitudinal terms of the viscous dissipation tensor. We have chosen to threshold the unreasonable high gradient terms based on outliers in the histograms of the gradients. For the first porous media the porous media the refinement was chosen a degree higher than the others, and led to `nan' results of the integrated relative contributions. For the two other porous media we have found reasonable results given in Table \ref{tab:sm1}. Since we have to filter out quit some data that exhibits unreasonable high values the percentages are not adding up to $100\%$. By visual inspection we can examine the term $\left|\nabla_i u_j\right|^2$ in all porous media and we see that the total dissipation correlates with gradients in the transverse direction. Also in this data we can see that for Porous Media 3 the relative contribution of the longitudinal term $ \left|\nabla_n u_p\right|^2$, $24\%$ is in the same order as the transversal term $ \left|\nabla_s u_p\right|^2$ which amounts to $32\%$. This observation is in agreement with the fitting of the two contributions in the paper.

The error estimation for the circularity and the HP model can be computed on the infinitesimal data, i.e. only using two consecutive iso-pressure surfaces, or on a whole pore. For the infinitesimal approach we have chosen to compare the left hand and right hand side of Eq.(9). For the HP model $f(\alpha)$ is set to $1$. For the integral approach the total resistance of a pore is computed by Eq.(13) and compared to the measured resistance given by $\Delta p/Q$. As already pointed out in the text, the Pearson Correlation coefficient is not a good measure for hetereoskedastic data, and the root-square-mean-error (RSME) does not cope well with data that spans multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore we have chosen to list the errors of the root-square-mean-error-relative error.

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]

 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
