  abstract = {While turbulent bursts are considered critical for blowing-snow transport and initiation, the interaction of the airflow with the snow surface is not fully understood. To better characterize the coupling of turbulent structures and blowing-snow transport, observations collected in natural environments at the necessary high-resolution time scales are needed. To address this, high-frequency measurements of turbulence, blowing-snow density and particle velocity were made in the Canadian Rockies. During blowing-snow storms, modified variable-interval time averaging enabled identification of periods of near-surface blowingsnow coupling with shear-stress-producing motions in the lowest 2 m of the atmospheric surface layer. The identification of those turbulent motions responsible for blowing snow yields a better understanding of the event-driven mechanics of initiation and sustained transport. The type of coherent structures generating the Reynolds stress are just as important as the magnitude of the Reynolds stress in initiating and sustaining near-surface blowing snow. Our results suggest that blowing-snow models driven by merely the time-averaged shear stress lack physical realism in the near-surface region. The next phase of the development of blowing-snow models should incorporate parametrizations of coherent turbulent structures.},

  abstract = {Vapor transport in snow and firn plays a key role in post-depositional changes of many reactive species, in mass and energy balance of large snow-covered areas, and in metamorphic changes of the crystal structure of the snow itself. While conventional estimates of vapor transport and sublimation rate are based on diffusion of water vapor from the snow surface to the atmosphere, ventilation (airflow through interstitial pore spaces) in snow and firn can affect the top several meters of firn, yet the effects of ventilation on sublimation rates in firn have not been previously investigated. In this paper we present the first calculations of sublimation rates due to advective/diffusive airflow and vapor transport in the snow and firn. Airflow velocities, vapor transport and sublimation rates are calculated using a two-dimensional finite-element model. The airflow patterns induce regions of sublimation and regions of condensation within the snow and firn. Because small surface sastrugi move in time as the snow surface profile changes due to wind redeposition, the subsurface flow and regions of condensation and sublimation will also likely change on a time-scale of days to weeks. However, if the roughness features are such that they move very little over time, it is likely that the regions of condensation and sublimation will have a noticeable effect on the microstructure of the firn. While the highest mass-transfer rates occur near the surface, the depth of vapor transport and phase change depends on firn properties, wavelength of the snow surface roughness, and temperature.},

We simulate flow, transport, and reaction in three pore-scale images: a beadpack, Bentheimer sandstone, and Doddington sandstone for a range of transport and reaction conditions. We compute the reaction rate, velocity distributions, and dispersion coefficient comparing them with the results for non-reactive transport. The rate of reaction is a subtle combination of the amount of mixing and spreading that cannot be predicted from the non-reactive dispersion coefficient. We demonstrate how the flow field heterogeneity affects the effective reaction rate. Dependent on the intrinsic flow field heterogeneity characteristic and the flow rate, reaction may: (a) occur throughout the zones where both resident and injected particles exist (for low P\'eclet number and a homogeneous flow field), (b) preferentially occur at the trailing edge of the plume (for high P\'eclet number and a homogeneous flow field), or (c) be disfavored in slow-moving zones (for high P\'eclet number and a heterogeneous flow field).},

  abstract = {Thin liquid water layers, so-called ``quasi-liquid layers'' (QLLs), exist on ice surfaces just below the melting point (0 \textdegree C). The formation of QLLs governs various important phenomena on Earth, such as weather- and environment-related issues, winter sports, etc. Hence, QLLs have attracted considerable attention in the fields of ice physics, meteorology, crystal growth, and surface science. Our molecular-level observation of QLLs by advanced optical microscopy reveals that QLLs are formed kinetically as metastable phases only in supersaturated water vapor. This finding opens new horizons of understanding QLLs, which have been so far discussed thermodynamically only at an equilibrium condition., Surfaces of ice are covered with thin liquid water layers, called quasi-liquid layers (QLLs), even below their melting point (0 \textdegree C), which govern a wide variety of phenomena in nature. We recently found that two types of QLL phases appear that exhibit different morphologies (droplets and thin layers) [Sazaki G. et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109(4):1052-1055]. However, revealing the thermodynamic stabilities of QLLs remains a longstanding elusive problem. Here we show that both types of QLLs are metastable phases that appear only if the water vapor pressure is higher than a certain critical supersaturation. We directly visualized the QLLs on ice crystal surfaces by advanced optical microscopy, which can detect 0.37-nm-thick elementary steps on ice crystal surfaces. At a certain fixed temperature, as the water vapor pressure decreased, thin-layer QLLs first disappeared, and then droplet QLLs vanished next, although elementary steps of ice crystals were still growing. These results clearly demonstrate that both types of QLLs are kinetically formed, not by the melting of ice surfaces, but by the deposition of supersaturated water vapor on ice surfaces. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that supersaturation of water vapor plays a crucially important role in the formation of QLLs.},

  abstract = {We performed X-ray microtomographic observations of wet-snow metamorphism during controlled continuous melting and melt-freeze events in the laboratory. Three blocks of snow were sieved into boxes and subjected to cyclic, superficial heating or heating-cooling to reproduce vertical water infiltration patterns in snow similarly to natural conditions. Periodically, samples were taken at different heights and scanned. Results suggest that wet-snow metamorphism dynamics are highly heterogeneous even in an initially homogeneous snowpack. Consistent with previous work, we observed an increase with time in the thickness of the ice structure, which is a measure of grain size. However, this was coupled with large temporal scatter between consecutive measurements of the specific surface area and of the statistical moments of grain thickness distributions. Because of marked differences in the right tail, grain thickness distributions did not show shape invariance with time, contrary to previous analyses. In our experiments, wet-snow metamorphism showed two strikingly different patterns: homogeneous coarsening superimposed by faster heterogeneous coarsening in areas that were affected by preferential percolation of water. Liquid water movement in snow and fast structural evolution may be thus intrinsically coupled by early formation of preferential flow at local scale. These observations suggest that further experiments are highly needed to fully understand wet-snow metamorphism and infiltration patterns in a natural snowpack.},

Both phases (liquid and vapor) are incompressible and immiscible. The interface between two phases is tracked with the color-function volume-of-fluid (CF-VOF) method. Surface tension is taken into consideration by the continuous surface force (CSF) model. Pressure-velocity coupling will be solved with the PISO algorithm in the collocated grid. The accuracy of this phase-change model is verified by two evaporation problems (a one-dimensional Stefan problem and a two-dimensional film-boiling problem) and two condensation problems (a one-dimensional Stefan problem and filmwise condensation). The simulation results of this model show good agreement with the classical analytical or numerical results, proving its accuracy and feasibility.},

  abstract = {Wet-snow avalanches are relatively poorly understood and difficult to forecast. By definition, water is required in the snow cover, thus assessing the liquid water content of the snow cover is of paramount importance for wet-snow avalanche forecasting. While evaluating wet-snow instability through field measurements is difficult, physically based snow cover models can be used to estimate the amount of liquid water within the snow cover using meteorological input. Recently, an index based on the liquid water content of the snow cover was suggested showing high potential to predict the onset of wet-snow avalanche activity. However, as the snow cover model was forced with data from automated weather stations (AWS) only a now-cast was possible. As snow cover conditions quickly change during snow melt, a forecast would be useful. For this study, we therefore force the 1-D physically based snow cover model SNOWPACK with data from the high-resolution numerical weather prediction model COSMO and investigate whether forecasting regional patterns of the onset of wet-snow avalanche activity is feasible. To validate the index, we compared simulations performed at the location of numerous AWS in the Swiss Alps with wet-snow avalanche observations from the corresponding region. Only by forcing SNOWPACK with data from automated weather stations up to the actual day and then adding the forecasted input data to produce a forecast led to results comparable to the simulations with station data only. While using this setup, the index was able to predict the onset of wet-snow avalanching with a probability of detection of {$>$}80\% for three winters between 2013 and 2016 and for two different climate regions in Switzerland. However, the false alarm ratio was high (up to 80\%), suggesting that further refinements of the classification method are needed.},

Both methods have been compared in terms of accuracy and computational effort. It is shown that they give comparable results if all numerical parameters are controlled carefully. LBM requires a much higher computational effort, however, in contrast to ASD it is able to simulate partially sintered agglomerates as well. The results show that even a very small amount of sintering leads to a significant reduction in the drag force. The analysis of the drag force on agglomerates as well as on aggregates shows that there is no simple geometric quantity which is uniquely related to the drag force. Moreover, there is a significant variation in drag force for single aggregates at different orientations or for the orientation averaged drag force of different aggregates of the same size. This is explained by the structural effects which may lead to a variation in the drag force up to {$\pm$}20\%.},

However, snow-cover and snowpack conditions change through time pose challenges for measuring and prediction of snow. Plausible scenarios of how Arctic snow cover will respond to changing Arctic climate are important for impact assessments and adaptation strategies. Although much progress has been made in understanding and predicting snow-cover changes and their multiple consequences, many uncertainties remain. In this paper, we review advances in snow monitoring and modelling, and the impact of snow changes on ecosystems and society in Arctic regions. Interdisciplinary activities are required to resolve the current limitations on measuring and modelling snow characteristics through the cold season and at different spatial scales to assure human well-being, economic stability, and improve the ability to predict manage and adapt to natural hazards in the Arctic region.},

For example, in subsurface environments, mixing of groundwater and injected solutions can induce mineral supersaturation of constituents and drive precipitation reactions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and microcomputed tomography ({$\mu$}-CT) were employed as complementary techniques to evaluate advection, dispersion, and formation of precipitate in a 3D porous media flow cell. Two parallel fluids were flowed concentrically through packed glass beads under two relative flow rates with Na2CO3 and CaCl2 in the inner and outer fluids, respectively. CaCO3 became supersaturated and formed a precipitate at the mixing interface between the two solutions. Spatial maps of changing local velocity fields and dispersion in the flow cell were generated from MRI, while high resolution {$\mu$}-CT imaging visualized the precipitate formed in the porous media. Formation of a precipitate minimized dispersive and advective transport between the two fluids and the shape of the precipitation front was influenced by the relative flow rates. This work demonstrates that the combined use of MRI and {$\mu$}-CT can be highly complementary in the study of reactive transport processes in porous media.},

Shorter effective diffusion distances were detected as a function of increased irreversible ice binding activity, indicating inhibition of ice recrystallization and persistent small crystal structure. The modification of ice structure by the IBP demonstrates a potential mechanism for the microorganism to enhance survivability in ice.

  abstract = {Laws of snow metamorphism have been introduced in a numerical model which simulates the evolution of temperature, density and liquid-water profiles of snow cover as a function of weather conditions.
To establish these laws, the authors have summarized previous studies on temperature gradient and on wet-snow metamorphism and they have also conducted metamorphism experiments on dry or wet fresh-snow samples. An original formalism was developed to allow a description of snow with parameters evolving continuously throughout time.
The introduction of laws of metamorphism has improved significantly the derivation of the settlement of internal layers and of snow-covered albedo, which depend on the simulated stratigraphy, i.e. the type and size of snow grains of different layers of the snow cover.
The model was tested during a whole winter season without any re-initialization. Comparison between the simulated characteristics of the snow cover and the observations made in the field are described in detail. The model proved itself to be very efficient in simulating accurately the evolution of the snow-cover stratigraphy throughout the whole winter season.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Understanding the slow densification process of polar firn into ice is essential in order to constrain the age difference between the ice matrix and entrapped gases. The progressive microstructure evolution of the firn column with depth leads to pore closure and gas entrapment. Air transport models in the firn usually include a closed porosity profile based on available data. Pycnometry or melting\textendash refreezing techniques have been used to obtain the ratio of closed to total porosity and air content in closed pores, respectively. X-ray-computed tomography is complementary to these methods, as it enables one to obtain the full pore network in 3-D. This study takes advantage of this nondestructive technique to discuss the morphological evolution of pores on four different Antarctic sites. The computation of refined geometrical parameters for the very cold polar sites Dome C and Lock In (the two Antarctic plateau sites studied here) provides new information that could be used in further studies. The comparison of these two sites shows a more tortuous pore network at Lock In than at Dome C, which should result in older gas ages in deep firn at Lock In. A comprehensive estimation of the different errors related to X-ray tomography and to the sample variability has been performed. The procedure described here may be used as a guideline for further experimental characterization of firn samples. We show that the closed-to-total porosity ratio, which is classically used for the detection of pore closure, is strongly affected by the sample size, the image reconstruction, and spatial heterogeneities. In this work, we introduce an alternative parameter, the connectivity index, which is practically independent of sample size and image acquisition conditions, and that accurately predicts the close-off depth and density. Its strength also lies in its simple computation, without any assumption of the pore status (open or close). The close-off prediction is obtained for Dome C and Lock In, without any further numerical simulations on images (e.g., by permeability or diffusivity calculations).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the most efficient proxy methods for paleoclimatology consists of obtaining data previously preserved within polar ice cores. Models for past climate reconstruction are based in particular on the characterization of entrapped gases in ice closed pores. Improving the temporal accuracy of these models requires a better understanding of firn densification mechanisms. In particular, the interplay between viscoplastic deformation and diffusion processes for pore closure is not well understood. In this work, we describe the first in situ laboratory densification experiments on polar firn retrieved from Antarctica with live characterization by X-ray tomography. Our in situ tests allow for the first time to approximately access the process of pore closure in ice, which takes thousands of years to occur in Antarctica, from visualizations and quantitative analyses of short time laboratory experiments. The parameters of pore separation and closure and the microstructural changes that accompany them are monitored. We show that densification of polar firn and pore closure could be replicated at higher strain rate and warmer temperature. Experiments allow the viscoplastic part of the firn deformation to be decoupled from the diffusion mechanisms that occur at high temperature. Our results show that density alone is not sufficient to predict the close-off density at which gases get entrapped. More generally, the method laid out here may find useful application in the domain of high temperature powder compaction, for which pore closure and grain growth are significant process parameters.},

The book covers both time and frequency domain methodologies, as well as advances in scattering and diffraction methods, multidimensional exchange and correlation experiments and orientational correlation methods ideal for studying anisotropic environments. At the heart of these new methods resides the ubiquitous spin echo, a phenomenon whose discovery underpins nearly every major development in magnetic resonance methodology. Measuring molecular translational motion does not require high spectral resolution and so finds application in new NMR technologies concerned with 'outside the laboratory' applications, in geophysics and petroleum physics, in horticulture, in food technology, in security screening and in environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {Snow fabric, defined as the distribution of the c-axis orientations of the ice crystals in snow, is poorly known. So far, only one study exits that measured snow fabric based on a statistically representative technique. This recent study has revealed the impact of temperature gradient metamorphism on the evolution of fabric in natural snow, based on cold laboratory experiments. On polar ice sheets, snow properties are currently investigated regarding their strong variability in time and space, notably because of their potential influence on firn processes and consequently on ice core analysis. Here, we present measurements of fabric and microstructure of snow from Point Barnola, East Antarctica (close to Dome C). We analyzed a snow profile from 0 to 3 m depth, where temperature gradients occur. The main contributions of the paper are (1) a detailed characterization of snow in the upper meters of the ice sheet, especially by providing data on snow fabric, and (2) the study of a fundamental snow process, never observed up to now in a natural snowpack, namely the role of temperature gradient metamorphism on the evolution of the snow fabric. Snow samples were scanned by micro-tomography to measure continuous profiles of microstructural properties (density, specific surface area and pore thickness). Fabric analysis was performed using an automatic ice texture analyzer on 77 representative thin sections cut out from the samples. Different types of snow fabric could be identified and persist at depth. Snow fabric is significantly correlated with snow microstructure, pointing to the simultaneous influence of temperature gradient metamorphism on both properties. We propose a mechanism based on preferential grain growth to explain the fabric evolution under temperature gradients. Our work opens the question of how such a layered profile of fabric and microstructure evolves at depth and further influences the physical and mechanical properties of snow and firn. More generally, it opens the way to further studies on the influence of the snow fabric in snow processes related to anisotropic properties of ice such as grain growth, mechanical response, electromagnetic behavior.},

Up to now, the description of these phenomena at the macroscopic scale, i.e., snow layer scale, in the snowpack models has been proposed in a phenomenological way. Here we used an upscaling method, namely, the homogenization of multiple-scale expansions, to derive theoretically the macroscopic equivalent modeling of heat and vapor transfer through a snow layer from the physics at the pore scale. The physical phenomena under consideration are steady state air flow, heat transfer by conduction and convection, water vapor transfer by diffusion and convection, and phase change (sublimation and deposition). We derived three different macroscopic models depending on the intensity of the air flow considered at the pore scale, i.e., on the order of magnitude of the pore Reynolds number and the P\'eclet numbers: (A) pure diffusion, (B) diffusion and moderate convection (Darcy's law), and (C) strong convection (nonlinear flow). The formulation of the models includes the exact expression of the macroscopic properties (effective thermal conductivity, effective vapor diffusion coefficient, and intrinsic permeability) and of the macroscopic source terms of heat and vapor arising from the phase change at the pore scale. Such definitions can be used to compute macroscopic snow properties from 3-D descriptions of snow microstructures. Finally, we illustrated the precision and the robustness of the proposed macroscopic models through 2-D numerical simulations.},

The full tensor of the effective thermal conductivity (keff) was computed from 30 three-dimensional images of the snow microstructure, spanning all types of seasonal snow. Only conduction through ice and interstitial air were considered. The obtained values are strongly correlated to snow density. The main cause for the slight scatter around the regression curve to snow density is the anisotropy of keff: the vertical component of keff of facetted crystals and depth hoar samples is up to 1.5 times larger than the horizontal component, while rounded grains sampled deeply in the snowpack exhibit the inverse behavior. Results of simulations neglecting the conduction in the interstitial air indicate that this phase plays a vital role in heat conduction through snow. The computed effective thermal conductivity is found to increase with decreasing temperature, mostly following the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity of ice. The results are compared to experimental data obtained either with the needle-probe technique or using combined measurements of the vertical heat flux and the corresponding temperature gradient. Needle-probe measurements are systematically significantly lower than those from the two other techniques.

  abstract = {Biofilms are ubiquitous bacterial communities that grow in various porous media including soils, trickling, and sand filters. In these environments, they play a central role in services ranging from degradation of pollutants to water purification. Biofilms dynamically change the pore structure of the medium through selective clogging of pores, a process known as bioclogging. This affects how solutes are transported and spread through the porous matrix, but the temporal changes to transport behavior during bioclogging are not well understood. To address this uncertainty, we experimentally study the hydrodynamic changes of a transparent 3-D porous medium as it experiences progressive bioclogging. Statistical analyses of the system's hydrodynamics at four time points of bioclogging (0, 24, 36, and 48 h in the exponential growth phase) reveal exponential increases in both average and variance of the flow velocity, as well as its correlation length. Measurements for spreading, as mean-squared displacements, are found to be non-Fickian and more intensely superdiffusive with progressive bioclogging, indicating the formation of preferential flow pathways and stagnation zones. A gamma distribution describes well the Lagrangian velocity distributions and provides parameters that quantify changes to the flow, which evolves from a parallel pore arrangement under unclogged conditions, toward a more serial arrangement with increasing clogging. Exponentially evolving hydrodynamic metrics agree with an exponential bacterial growth phase and are used to parameterize a correlated continuous time random walk model with a stochastic velocity relaxation. The model accurately reproduces transport observations and can be used to resolve transport behavior at intermediate time points within the exponential growth phase considered.},

  abstract = {In the absence of imposed temperature gradients, the metamorphism of dry snow is dominated by the slow process of vapor diffusion between surfaces of different radii of curvature. This process is so slow in a seasonal snow cover (where temperatures normally change on the scale of hours or days) that vapor migration is usually dominated by the imposed temperature gradient. Thus radius of curvature contributes to but does not control metamorphism except for short periods in very fresh snow. As opposed to dry snow, liquid-saturated snow (i.e. pore space filled by the melt) is metamorphosed by heat flow arising from relatively large temperature differences among the particles. Grain growth in liquid-saturated snow is rapid because of the large temperature differences at nearly constant liquid pressure. In wet snow with low liquid content (2-5\% by volume), grain growth is dominated by vapor diffusion (as in dry snow) so grain growth is much slower than under conditions of liquid saturation.

R\'esum\'e
En l'absence de gradients de temp\'erature impos\'es, la m\'etamorphose de la neige s\'eche est domin\'ee par le processus lent de diffusion de vapeur entre les surfaces de diff\'erents rayons de courbure. Ce processus est si lent dans un couvert neigeux saisonnier (o\`u les temp\'eratures varient normalement \`a l'\'echelle des heures ou des jours) que la migration de vapeur est g\'en\'eralement domin\'ee par le gradient thermique impos\'e. Par cons\'equent, le rayon de courbure contribue \'a la m\'etamorphose mais ne la Contr\^ole pas except\'e pour de courtes p\'eriodes dans la neige tr\'es fra\^iche. Au contraire de la neige fra\^iche, la neige satur\'ee d'eau (c`est-\'a-dire dont les pores sont remplies d'eau de fusion) est transform par le flux de chaleur entran\'e par de relativement fortes differences de temp\'erature entre les particules. La croissance des grains dans la neige satur\'ee d`eau liquide est rapide en raison de fortes diff\'erences de temp\'eratures \`a des pressions de liquides \`a peu pres constantes. Dans la neige humide \`a faible teneur en can liquide (2 \'a 5\% en volume), la croissance des grains est r\'egl\'ee par la diffusion de vapeur (comme dans la neige s\'eche) si bien que la croissance des grains y est beaucoup plus lente que dans les conditions de saturation en liquide.

Zusammenfassung
Beim Fehlen aufgepr\"agter Temperaturgradienten wild die Metamorphose trockerien Schnees durch den angsamen Prozess der Dampfdiffusion zwisehen Oberfl\"achen mit verschiedcnen Kr\"ummungsradien bewirkt. Dieser Prozess ist in der Schneedecke eines Jahres (wo die Temperaturen gew\"ohnlich innerhalb von Stunden Oder Tagen wechsehi) so langsam, dass die Dampfwanderung meist durch den aufgepr\"agten Temperaturgradienten gesteuert wird. So spielt der Kr\"ummungsradius bei der Metamorphose cine nur untergeordnete Rolle, ausser in den kurzen Perioden nach Neuschneefall. Im Gegensatz zu trockenem Schnee wird wasscr-gesattigter Schnee (d.h. wenn die Poren mit Schmelzwasser gef\"ullt sind) durch W\"armefluss infolge der relativ grossen Temperaturunterschiede zwisehen den Partikeln umgebildet. Im wasserges\"attigtem Schnee wachsen die K\"orner infolge der hohen Temperaturdifferenzen bei ann\"ahernd konstantem Wasserdruck schnell. In feuchtem Schnee mit niedrigem Wassergehalt (2-5\% des Volumens) wird das Kornwachstum durch die Dampfdiffusion (wie in trockenem Schnee) beherrscht; es geht daher viel langsamer vor sich als bei Wassers\"attigung.},

Here we propose a fragmentation theory of fractal snow crystals that explicitly links the size distribution of blowing snow particles to that of falling snow crystals. We use discrete element modeling of the fragmentation process to support the assumptions made in our theory. By combining this fragmentation model with a statistical mechanics model of blowing snow, we are able to reproduce the characteristic features of blowing snow size distributions measured in the field and in a wind tunnel. In particular, both model and measurements show the emergence of a self-similar scaling for large particle sizes and a systematic deviation from this scaling for small particle sizes.},

  abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method is a popular tool for pore-scale simulation of flow. This is likely due to the ease of including complex geometries such as porous media and representing multiphase and multifluid flows. Many advancements, including multiple relaxation times, increased isotropy, and others have improved the accuracy and physical fidelity of the method. Additionally, the lattice Bolzmann method is computationally very efficient, thanks to the explicit nature of the algorithm and relatively large amount of local work. The combination of many algorithmic options and efficiency means that a software framework enabling the usage and comparison of these advancements on computers from laptops to large clusters has much to offer. In this paper, we introduce Taxila LBM, an open-source software framework for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We discuss the design of the framework and lay out the features available, including both methods in the literature and a few new enhancements which generalize methods to complex geometries. We discuss the trade-off of accuracy and performance in various methods, noting how the Taxila LBM makes it easy to perform these comparisons for real problems. And finally, we demonstrate a few common applications in pore-scale simulation, including the characterization of permeability of a Berea sandstone and analysis of multifluid flow in heterogenous micromodels.},

We calculate all the different terms of particle stress for the first time for non-spherical particles, i.e. in addition to the stresslet, we calculate the acceleration and Reynolds stress, which are typically ignored in previous similar works. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for all these terms to verify the numerical results and deduce the effect of inertia by comparing our numerical results with the analytical solution. The effect of particle Reynolds number (Re), volume fraction ({$\varphi$}), and the shape of particles has been studied on all mechanisms of stress generation, the intrinsic viscosity, and normal stress differences of the suspension for the range 0.008 {$\varphi$} 0.112 and 0.01 Re 10.0. We found that inertia increases the shear and the second normal difference of the stresslet (dominant term of the particle stress), and decreases the first normal difference that is generated due to the strain field. The contribution of acceleration stress to the total stress is found to be important in the second normal stress difference, with a cycle-average comparable to the stresslet component. We also discovered that the contribution of Reynolds stress in the first normal stress difference becomes important even when inertia is as low as Re {$\sim$} O(0.1), and its value can be even greater than the stresslet when inertia increases, i.e. Reynolds stresses cannot be ignored for non-spherical particles. For concentrations in the range from dilute to semi-dilute, the effect of inertia on the intrinsic viscosity of a suspension is found to be comparable to the volume fraction. Furthermore, our calculations show that for a dilute concentration and the low-inertia regime (Re {$<$} 1.0), the intrinsic viscosity of a suspension consisting of ellipsoids with an aspect ratio of five can be 20 \% higher than its Stokesian analytical value.},

  abstract = {The free energy of hard-sphere systems provides a direct link between the particle-scale structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties. Here, we employ this framework to investigate the shear-induced structure of a colloidal glass, and link it to its macroscopic mechanical and thermodynamic state. We measure the nonequilibrium free energy under shear from the free volumes of the particles, and monitor its evolution with the applied strain. Unlike crystals, for which the elastic energy increases quadratically with strain due to affine particle displacements, for glasses the free energy decreases due to non-affine displacements and dissipation, reflecting the ability of the glass to reach deeper free-energy minima. We model this decrease using the nonaffine shear modulus and a standard viscous dissipative term. Our model and measurements allow us to disentangle the complex contributions of affine and nonaffine particle displacements in the transient shear deformation of glasses.},

  abstract = {The idea that normal grain growth driven by surface tension may be described theoretically by the hypothesis that the local velocity of an element of grain boundary is proportional to its local mean curvature dates back more than half a century. von Neumann was the first to derive this relation and used it to predict the rate of evolution of a two dimensional cell structure. MacPherson and Srolovitz extended this development to describe growth in three dimensions; however, their result was couched in terms that did not facilitate tests of the theory. In this paper expected value theorems established in stereology are invoked to extend their result to provide a new equation that predicts the rate of change of volume of grains in a microstructure which, while preserving the rigor and generality of the result, expresses it in terms of quantities that can be measured in microstructures. This is illustrated with a set of measurements based upon the theory derived from a grain growth simulation that successfully tests its predictions. It is interesting that this result also exhibits an ``n-6 rule'' that is similar to, but not identical with, that contained in von Neumann's theory.},

Automatic measurements of temperature inside the snowpack led to examination of the triggering of avalanches in cold conditions following a rapid drop in temperature. The mechanical properties of ice depend on the slab temperature and I ask: could a rapid temperature change affect the mechanical properties differently considering a slab consisting of (1) rounded grains or (2) faceted grains? Snow is considered as a foam of ice crystals, and triaxial deformation tests are performed at constant strain rate to examine the influence of temperature and grain type on the mechanical properties. Although the snow densities in the two sample sets were almost identical, some differences due to grain type were observed. In particular, the set with faceted grain snow started to flow at higher stresses than the set with rounded grains.},

We present an effective description of non-Fickian behavior that reflects the dichotomy between the continuum nature of Fick's law and the finite (effective) observation scale associated with experimental studies of transport phenomena in heterogeneous systems. This dichotomy gives rise to a time delay between the cause and effect, i.e. between the concentration gradient and the mass flux. Evolving scales of heterogeneity induce a spectrum of such delay times that can lead to anomalous behavior. The presented model is a direct generalization of Fick's law and the well-established delay diffusion model. It complements effective modeling frameworks based on stochastic non-local theories and continuous time random walks.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the mechanisms of dispersion in the laminar flow through the pore space of a three-dimensional porous medium. We focus on preasymptotic transport prior to the asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion regime, in which solute motion may be described by the average flow velocity and a hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient. High-performance numerical flow and transport simulations of solute breakthrough at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium evidence marked deviations from the hydrodynamic dispersion paradigm and identify two distinct regimes. The first regime is characterised by a broad distribution of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is characterised by diffusive mass transfer into low-velocity regions in the wake of solid grains. These mechanisms are quantified systematically in the framework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements (particles) of the transported material quantity. Particle transitions occur over the length scale imprinted in the pore structure at random times given by heterogeneous advection and diffusion. Under globally advection-dominated conditions, i.e., P\'eclet numbers larger than 1, particles sample the intrapore velocities by diffusion and the interpore velocities through advection. Thus, for a single transition, particle velocities are approximated by the mean pore velocity. In order to quantify this advection mechanism, we develop a model for the statistics of the Eulerian velocity magnitude based on Poiseuille's law for flow through a single pore and for the distribution of mean pore velocities, both of which are linked to the distribution of pore diameters. Diffusion across streamlines through immobile zones in the wake of solid grains gives rise to exponentially distributed residence times that decay on the diffusion time over the pore length. The trapping rate is determined by the inverse diffusion time. This trapping mechanism is represented by a compound Poisson process conditioned on the advective residence time in the proposed time-domain random walk approach. The model is parameterised with the characteristics of the porous medium under consideration and captures both preasymptotic regimes. Macroscale transport is described by an integro-differential equation for solute concentration, whose memory kernels are given in terms of the distribution of mean pore velocities and trapping times. This approach quantifies the physical non-equilibrium caused by a broad distribution of mass transfer time scales, both advective and diffusive, on the representative elementary volume (REV). Thus, while the REV indicates the scale at which medium properties like porosity can be uniquely defined, this does not imply that transport can be characterised by hydrodynamic dispersion.},

  abstract = {The values of the snow and soil thermal conductivity, ksnow and ksoil, strongly impact the thermal regime of the ground in the Arctic, but very few data are available to test model predictions for these variables. We have monitored ksnow and ksoil using heated needle probes at Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic (73{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 80{$\smwhtcircle$} W) between July 2013 and July 2015. Few ksnow data were obtained during the 2013\textendash 2014 winter, because little snow was present. During the 2014\textendash 2015 winter ksnow monitoring at 2, 12 and 22 cm heights and field observations show that a depth hoar layer with ksnow around 0.02 W m-1 K-1 rapidly formed. At 12 and 22 cm, wind slabs with ksnow around 0.2 to 0.3 W m-1 K-1 formed. The monitoring of ksoil at 10 cm depth shows that in thawed soil ksoil was around 0.7 W m-1 K-1, while in frozen soil it was around 1.9 W m-1 K-1. The transition between both values took place within a few days, with faster thawing than freezing and a hysteresis effect evidenced in the thermal conductivity\textendash liquid water content relationship. The fast transitions suggest that the use of a bimodal distribution of ksoil for modelling may be an interesting option that deserves further testing. Simulations of ksnow using the snow physics model Crocus were performed. Contrary to observations, Crocus predicts high ksnow values at the base of the snowpack (0.12\textendash 0.27 W m-1 K-1) and low ones in its upper parts (0.02\textendash 0.12 W m-1 K-1). We diagnose that this is because Crocus does not describe the large upward water vapour fluxes caused by the temperature gradient in the snow and soil.},

At Ward Hunt Island (Canadian high Arctic, 83\textdegree 05{${'}$}N, 74\textdegree 07{${'}$}W) almost no depth hoar was observed in spring 2016 despite favorable thermal conditions. We hypothesize that depth hoar formation was impeded by the combination of two factors (1) strong winds in fall that formed hard dense wind slabs where water vapor transport was slow and (2) low soil moisture that led to rapid ground cooling with no zero-curtain period, which reduced soil temperature and the temperature gradient in the snowpack. Comparisons with detailed data from the subsequent winter at Ward Hunt and from Bylot Island (73\textdegree 09{${'}$}N, 80\textdegree 00{${'}$}W) and with data from Barrow and Alert indicate that both high wind speeds after snow onset and low soil moisture are necessary to prevent Arctic depth hoar formation. The role of convection to form depth hoar is discussed. A simple preliminary strategy to parameterize depth hoar thermal conductivity in snow schemes is proposed based on wind speed and soil moisture. Finally, warming-induced vegetation growth and soil moisture increase should reduce depth hoar thermal conductivity, potentially affecting permafrost temperature.},

In a set of field experiments, we injected a dilute mixture of 1 \% carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen gas (N2) of known volume into the topmost layer of a snowpack and, using a distributed array of thin film sensors, measured plume evolution as a function of wind forcing. We found enhanced dispersion in the streamwise direction and also along low-resistance pathways in the presence of wind. These results suggest that atmospheric constituents contained in snow can be anisotropically mixed depending on the wind environment and snow structure, having implications for surface snow reaction rates and interpretation of firn and ice cores.},

  abstract = {The growth dynamics of D2O ice in liquid H2O in a microfluidic device were investigated between the melting points of D2O ice (3.8 \textdegree C) and H2O ice (0 \textdegree C). As the temperature was decreased at rates between 0.002 \textdegree C/s and 0.1 \textdegree C/s, the ice front advanced but retreated immediately upon cessation of cooling, regardless of the temperature. This is a consequence of the competition between diffusion of H2O into the D2O ice, which favors melting of the interface, and the driving force for growth supplied by cooling. Raman microscopy tracked H/D exchange across the solid H2O\textendash solid D2O interface, with diffusion coefficients consistent with transport of intact H2O molecules at the D2O ice interface. At fixed temperatures below 3 \textdegree C, the D2O ice front melted continuously, but at temperatures near 0 \textdegree C a scalloped interface morphology appeared with convex and concave sections that cycled between growth and retreat. This behavior, not observed for D2O ice in contact with D2O liquid or H2O ice in contact with H2O liquid, reflects a complex set of cooperative phenomena, including H/D exchange across the solid\textendash liquid interface, latent heat exchange, local thermal gradients, and the Gibbs\textendash Thomson effect on the melting points of the convex and concave features.},

A better understanding of wet snow and the first starting point of water percolation in the seasonal snowpack is essential for snow pack stability, snow melt run-off and remote sensing. In order to induce and measure precisely the liquid water and the corresponding dielectric properties inside a snow sample, an experimental setup was developed. Using microwave heating at 18\&amp;\#8201;kHz allows the use of dielectric properties of ice to enable heat to be dissipated homogeneously through the entire volume of snow. A desired liquid water content inside the snow sample could then be created and analysed in a micro-computer tomography. Based on the electrical monitoring a promising perspective for retrieving water content and water distribution in the snowpack is given. The heating process and extraction of water content are mainly dependent on the morphological properties of snow, the temperature and the liquid water content. The experimental observation can be divided in three different heating processes affecting the dielectric properties of snow for different densities: (1) dry snow heating process up to 0\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#176;C indicating a temperature and snow structure dependency of the dielectric property of snow; (2) wet snow heating at stagnating temperature of 0\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#176;C and the presence of uniformed distributed liquid water changes the dielectric properties. The presence of liquid water decreases the impedance of the snow sample until water starts to percolate; and (3) the start of water percolation is between 5\&amp;\#8211;12 water volume fraction depending on the snow density and confirms the literature findings. The onset of water percolation initiated an inhomogeneity in snow and water distribution, strongly affecting the dielectric properties of the snow. These findings are pertinent to the interpretation of the snow melt run-off of spring snow. These laboratory measurements allow to find the narrow range of the starting point of water percolation in coarse-grained snow and to extract the corresponding dielectric properties which is important for remote sensing.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {Snow at or close to the surface commonly undergoes temperature gradient metamorphism under advective flow, which alters its microstructure and physical properties. A functional understanding of this process is essential for many disciplines, from modeling the effects of snow on regional and global climate to assessing avalanche formation. Time-lapse X-ray microtomography was applied to investigate the structural dynamics of temperature gradient snow metamorphism exposed to an advective airflow in controlled laboratory conditions. Experiments specifically analyzed sublimation and deposition of water vapor on the ice structure. In addition, an analysis of the ice-air interface dynamics was carried out using a macroscopic equivalent model of heat and water vapor transport through a snow layer. The results indicate that sublimation of the ice matrix dominated for flow rates {$<$} 10-6 m3 s-1 while during increased mass flow rates the water vapor deposition supplied by the advective flow counteracted sublimation. A flow rate dependence of water vapor deposition at the ice interface was observed, asymptotically approaching an average estimated maximum deposition rate on the whole sample of 1.05 {$\cdot$} 10-4 kg m-3 s-1. The growth of microsized whisker-like crystals on larger ice crystals was detected on microscope photographs, leading to an increase of the specific surface area and thus suggest a change of the physical and optical properties of the snow. The estimated values of the curvature effect of the ice crystals and the interface kinetic coefficient are in good agreement with previously published values.},

An X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT) system was used to record a total of 1601 projections of a snow volume. Experiments were performed in-situ at four load states as 0 MPa, 0.3 MPa, 0.6 MPa and 0.8 MPa, to investigate the effect of compaction on structural features of snow grains. The micro-CT system produces high resolution images (4.3 \&mu;m voxel) in 6 h of scanning time. The micro-CT images of the investigated snow volume illustrate that grain shapes are mostly dominated by needles, capped columns and dendrites. It was found that a significant number of grains appeared to have a deep hollow core irrespective of the grain shape. Digital volume correlation (DVC) was applied to investigate displacement and strain fields in the snow volume due to the compaction. Results from the DVC analysis show that grains close to the moving punch experience most of the displacement. The reconstructed snow volume is segmented into several cylinders via horizontal cross-sectioning, to evaluate the vertical heterogeneity of porosity distribution of the snow volume. It was observed that the porosity (for the whole volume) in principle decreases as the level of compaction increases. A distinct vertical heterogeneity is observed in porosity distribution in response to compaction. The observations from this initial study may be useful to understand the snow microstructure under applied stress.},

  abstract = {An important feature of natural ice, in addition to the obvious relevance of glaciers and ice sheets for climate-related issues, is its ability to creep on geological time scales and low deviatoric stresses at temperatures very close to its melting point, without losing its polycrystalline character. This fact, together with its strong mechanical anisotropy and other notable properties, makes natural ice an interesting model material for studying the high-temperature creep and recrystallization of rocks in Earth's interior. After having reviewed the major contributions of deep ice coring to the research on natural ice microstructures in Part I of this work (Faria et~al., 2014), here in Part II we present an up-to-date view of the modern understanding of natural ice microstructures and the deformation processes that may produce them. In particular, we analyze a large body of evidence that reveals fundamental flaws in the widely accepted tripartite paradigm of polar ice microstructure (also known as the ``three-stage model,'' cf. Part I). These results prove that grain growth in ice sheets is dynamic, in the sense that it occurs during deformation and is markedly affected by the stored strain energy, as well as by air inclusions and other impurities. The strong plastic anisotropy of the ice lattice gives rise to high internal stresses and concentrated strain heterogeneities in the polycrystal, which demand large amounts of strain accommodation. From the microstructural analyses of ice cores, we conclude that the formation of many and diverse subgrain boundaries and the splitting of grains by rotation recrystallization are the most fundamental mechanisms of dynamic recovery and strain accommodation in polar ice. Additionally, in fine-grained, high-impurity ice layers (e.g. cloudy bands), strain may sometimes be accommodated by diffusional flow (at low temperatures and stresses) or microscopic grain boundary sliding via microshear (in anisotropic ice sheared at high temperatures). Grain boundaries bulged by migration recrystallization and subgrain boundaries are endemic and very frequent at almost all depths in ice sheets. Evidence of nucleation of new grains is also observed at various depths, provided that the local concentration of strain energy is high enough (which is not seldom the case). As a substitute for the tripartite paradigm, we propose a novel dynamic recrystallization diagram in the three-dimensional state space of strain rate, temperature, and mean grain size, which summarizes the various competing recrystallization processes that contribute to the evolution of the polar ice microstructure.},

  abstract = {Polar ice sheets play a fundamental role in Earth's climate system, by interacting actively and passively with the environment. Active interactions include the creeping flow of ice and its effects on polar geomorphology, global sea level, ocean and atmospheric circulation, and so on. Passive interactions are mainly established by the formation of climate records within the ice, in form of air bubbles, dust particles, salt microinclusions and other derivatives of airborne impurities buried by recurrent snowfalls. For a half-century scientists have been drilling deep ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland for studying such records, which can go back to around a million years. Experience shows, however, that the ice-sheet flow generally disrupts the stratigraphy of the bottom part of deep ice cores, destroying the integrity of the oldest records. For all these reasons glaciologists have been studying the microstructure of polar ice cores for decades, in order to understand the genesis and fate of ice-core climate records, as well as to learn more about the physical properties of polar ice, aiming at better climate-record interpretations and ever more precise models of ice-sheet dynamics. In this Part I we review the main difficulties and advances in deep ice core drilling in Antarctica and Greenland, together with the major contributions of deep ice coring to the research on natural ice microstructures. In particular, we discuss in detail the microstructural findings from Camp Century, Byrd, Dye 3, GRIP, GISP2, NorthGRIP, Vostok, Dome C, EDML, and Dome Fuji, besides commenting also on the earlier results of some pioneering ventures, like the Jungfraujoch Expedition and the Norwegian\textendash British\textendash Swedish Antarctic Expedition, among others.

The new algorithm is based on the direct discretization of the collision/coalescence kernel derived in the framework of a joint fluid\textendash particle pdf approach proposed by Simonin et al. (2002). This approach allows to take into account correlations between colliding inertial particle velocities induced by their interaction with the fluid turbulence. Validation is performed by comparing the Monte-Carlo predictions with deterministic simulations of discrete solid particles coupled with Direct Numerical Simulation (DPS/DNS), or Large Eddy Simulation (DPS/LES), where the collision/coalescence effects are treated in a deterministic way. Five cases are investigated: elastic monodisperse particles, non-elastic monodisperse particles, binary mixture of elastic particles and binary mixture of elastic settling particles in turbulent flow and finally coalescing droplets. The predictions using the new Monte-Carlo algorithm are in much better agreement with DPS/DNS results than the ones using the standard algorithm.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamics of particle clusters suspended in viscous fluids is a subject of considerable theoretical and practical importance. Using a multipole expansion of the flow velocity in a series of spherical harmonics, Lamb's fundamental solution of the Stokes flow outside a single sphere is generalized in this work to the case of N nonoverlapping spheres of arbitrary size with slip boundary conditions. The expansion coefficients are found by transforming the boundary conditions to the Lamb form and by transforming the spherical coordinates and solid spherical harmonics centered at different spheres. The problem is reduced to the solution of the linear system of equations for the expansion coefficients, which is carried out numerically. Based on the developed theory, the relation between the hydrodynamic and gyration radius of fractal-like aggregates with different structure is established. In another application, an asymptotic slip-regime dependence of the aggregate hydrodynamic radius on the Knudsen number and the number of particles is found by performing calculations of drag forces acting on the gas-borne fractal-like and straight chain aggregates. A good agreement is shown in comparing predictions of the described theory with available experimental and theoretical results on motion of various small sphere clusters in viscous fluid.},

  abstract = {Water vapor transport in dry snowpacks plays a significant role for snow metamorphism and the mass and energy balance of snowpacks. The molecular diffusion of water vapor in the interstitial pores is usually considered as the main or only transport mechanism, and current detailed snow physics models therefore rely on the knowledge of the effective diffusion coefficient of water vapor in snow. Numerous previous studies have concluded that water vapor diffusion in snow is enhanced 5 relative to that in air. Various field observations also indicate that for vapor transport in snow to be explained by diffusion alone, the effective diffusion coefficient should be larger than that in air. Here we show using theory and numerical simulations on idealized and measured snow microstructures that, although sublimation and condensation of water vapor onto snow crystal surfaces do enhance microscopic diffusion in the pore space, this effect is more than countered by the restriction of diffusion space due to ice. The interaction of water vapor with the ice results in water vapor diffusing more than inert molecules in snow, 10 but still less than in free air, regardless of the value of the accommodation coefficient of water on ice. Our results imply that processes other than diffusion, probably convection, play a preponderant role in water vapor transport in dry snowpacks.},

  abstract = {A fluid in a pore can form diverse heterogeneous structures. We combine a capillary description with the cubic-plus-association equation of state to study the thermodynamic stability of droplets, bubbles and films of water at 358 K in a cylindrically symmetric pore. The equilibrium structure depends strongly on the size of the pore and whether the pore is closed or connected to a particle reservoir. A new methodology is presented to analyze the thermodynamic stability of films, where the integral that describes the total energy of the system is approximated by a quadrature rule. We show that, for large pores, the thermodynamic stability limit of adsorbed droplets and bubbles in both open and closed pores is governed by their mechanical stability, which is closely linked to the pore shape. This is also the case for a film in a closed pore. In open pores, the film is chemically unstable except for very low film-phase contact angles and for a limited range in external pressure. This result emphasizes the need to invoke a complete thermodynamic stability analysis, and not restrict the discussion to mechanical stability. A common feature for most of the heterogeneous structures examined is the appearance of regions where the structure is metastable with respect to a pore filled with a homogeneous fluid. In the closed pores, these regions grow considerably in size when the pores become smaller. [...] Complete phase diagrams are presented that compare all the investigated structures. In open pores at equilibrium, the most stable structure is either the homogeneous phase or adsorbed droplets and bubbles, depending on the type of phase in the external reservoir. Smaller pores allow for droplets and bubbles to adsorb for a larger span in pressure. In closed pores, most of the investigated configurations can occur depending on the total density, the contact angle and the pore shape. [...]},

We show that, for large pores, the thermodynamic stability limit of adsorbed droplets and bubbles in both open and closed pores is governed by their mechanical stability, which is closely linked to the pore shape. This is also the case for a film in a closed pore. In open pores, the film is chemically unstable except for very low film-phase contact angles and for a limited range in external pressure. This result emphasizes the need to invoke a complete thermodynamic stability analysis, and not restrict the discussion to mechanical stability. A common feature for most of the heterogeneous structures examined is the appearance of regions where the structure is metastable with respect to a pore filled with a homogeneous fluid. In the closed pores, these regions grow considerably in size when the pores become smaller. This can be understood from the larger energy cost of the interfaces relative to the energy gained from having two phases. Complete phase diagrams are presented that compare all the investigated structures. In open pores at equilibrium, the most stable structure is either the homogeneous phase or adsorbed droplets and bubbles, depending on the type of phase in the external reservoir. Smaller pores allow for droplets and bubbles to adsorb for a larger span in pressure. In closed pores, most of the investigated configurations can occur depending on the total density, the contact angle, the pore shape and the pore size. The analysis presented in this work is a step towards developing a thermodynamic framework to map the rich heterogeneous phase diagrams of porous media and other confined systems.},

  abstract = {We develop a model describing the buoyancy-driven propagation of two-phase gravity currents, motivated by problems in groundwater hydrology and geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2). In these settings, fluid invades a porous medium saturated with an immiscible second fluid of different density and viscosity. The action of capillary forces in the porous medium results in spatial variations of the saturation of the two fluids. Here, we consider the propagation of fluid in a semi-infinite porous medium across a horizontal, impermeable boundary. In such systems, once the aspect ratio is large, fluid flow is mainly horizontal and the local saturation is determined by the vertical balance between capillary and gravitational forces. Gradients in the hydrostatic pressure along the current drive fluid flow in proportion to the saturationdependent relative permeabilities, thus determining the shape and dynamics of twophase currents. The resulting two-phase gravity current model is attractive because the formalism captures the essential macroscopic physics of multiphase flow in porous media. Residual trapping of CO2 by capillary forces is one of the key mechanisms that can permanently immobilize CO2 in the societally important example of geological CO2 sequestration. The magnitude of residual trapping is set by the areal extent and saturation distribution within the current, both of which are predicted by the two-phase gravity current model. Hence the magnitude of residual trapping during the post-injection buoyant rise of CO2 can be estimated quantitatively. We show that residual trapping increases in the presence of a capillary fringe, despite the decrease in average saturation.},

The package assists the user with managing and interacting with all the topological, geometrical, and thermophysical data. It also includes a suite of commonly used algorithms for simulating percolation and performing transport calculations on pore networks. Most importantly, it was designed to be highly flexible to suit any application and be easily customized to include user-specified pore-scale physics models. The framework is fast, powerful, and concise. An illustrative example is included that determines the effective diffusivity through a partially water-saturated porous material with just 29 lines of code.},

  abstract = {A pore network model of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell is developed and validated. The model idealizes the GDL as a regular cubic network of pore bodies and pore throats following respective size distributions. Geometric parameters of the pore network model are calibrated with respect to porosimetry and gas permeability measurements for two common GDL materials and the model is subsequently used to compute the pore-scale distribution of water and gas under drainage conditions using an invasion percolation algorithm. From this information, the relative permeability of water and gas and the effective gas diffusivity are computed as functions of water saturation using resistor-network theory. Comparison of the model predictions with those obtained from constitutive relationships commonly used in current PEMFC models indicates that the latter may significantly overestimate the gas phase transport properties. Alternative relationships are suggested that better match the pore network model results. The pore network model is also used to calculate the limiting current in a PEMFC under operating conditions for which transport through the GDL dominates mass transfer resistance. The results suggest that a dry GDL does not limit the performance of a PEMFC, but it may become a significant source of concentration polarization as the GDL becomes increasingly saturated with water.},

Vertical profiles of mass flux and of the distribution of particle diameters were obtained by means of a pair of Snow Particle Counters parallel with measurements of the stream-wise velocity profile. The aim of the paper is to discuss current parameterizations of the vertical mass flux profile for fresh snow and to investigate the range of timescales involved in a developing saltation layer occurring in a turbulent boundary layer. The novelty of the work consists of using an intact fresh snow cover as an erodible surface able to provide realistic snow crystals as drifting particles. Results show that (1) the parameters scaling the vertical mass flux profiles of fresh snow can significantly differ from those given in the literature for ice or compacted snow particles; (2) though drifting snow covers an extremely wide range of temporal scales, the mean time interval between saltating particles {$\langle\Delta$}t{$\rangle$} is the key timescale of the saltation process; (3) {$\langle\Delta$}t{$\rangle$} allows for the optimal reconstruction of the mass flux as a continuous signal and for neglecting the effects related to the heterogeneous distribution of particle size on the mass flux. Implications on the modeling of snow drift and on the processing of field observations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Diffusion weighted imaging has opened new diagnostic possibilities by using microscopic diffusion of water molecules as a means of image contrast. The directional dependence of diffusion has led to the development of diffusion tensor imaging, which allows us to characterize microscopic tissue geometry. The link between the measured NMR signal and the self-diffusion tensor is established by the so-called b matrices that depend on the gradient's direction, strength, and timing. However, in the calculation of b-matrix elements, the influence of imaging gradients on each element of the b matrix is often neglected. This may cause errors, which in turn leads to an incorrect extraction of diffusion coefficients. In cases where the imaging gradients are high (high spatial resolution), these errors may be substantial. Using a generic pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) imaging sequence, the effects of neglecting the imaging gradients on the b-matrix calculation are demonstrated. By measuring an isotropic phantom with this sequence it can be analytically as well as experimentally shown that large deviations in single b-matrix elements are generated. These deviations are obtained by applying the diffusion weighting in the readout direction of the imaging dimension in combination with relatively large imaging gradients. The systematic errors can be avoided by a full b-matrix calculation considering all the gradients of the sequence or by generating cross-term free signals using the geometric average of two diffusion weighted images with opposite polarity. The importance of calculating the exact b matrices by the proposed methods is based on the fact that more precise diffusion parameters are obtained for extracting correct property maps, such as fractional anisotropy, volume ratio, or conductivity tensor maps. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Measurements from Lagrangian spiral soundings and constant-altitude flight legs are analyzed. Comparisons are made with observations in clear air. Each cirrus case contained a statically stable layer, a conditionally unstable or neutrally stratified layer (ice pseudoadiabatic) in which convection was prevalent, and a neutral layer in which convection was intermittent. The analysis indicates that a mixture of phenomena occurred including small-scale convective cells, gravity waves ({$\lambda\approx$}2\textendash 9 km), quasi-two-dimensional waves ({$\lambda\approx$}10\textendash 20 km), and larger two-dimensional mesoscale waves ({$\lambda\approx$}100 km). The intermediate-scale waves, observed both in clear air and in the cloud systems, likely played an important role in the development of the cloud systems given the magnitude of the associated vertical air velocity. The spectra of perturbations of wind components for layers where convection was prevalent were characterized by a {$\kappa-$}5/3 power law dependence, while a {$\kappa-$}2/4 dependence was found at other levels in the cloud systems. A steeper spectral slope ({$\kappa-$}3) was found in the more stable cloud-base layer on 19 October. Samples in clear air also showed a ({$\kappa-$}2.4) dependence. Flight-leg-averaged eddy potential heat fluxes (H={$\pm$}8 W m-2) were comparable to observations in marine stratocumulus clouds. Calculated turbulence dissipation rates agree with previously published studies, which indicate a general enhancement within cloud systems (10-6 to 10-3 m2 s-3 in cloud versus values less than 0.5\texttimes 10-6 m2 s-3 in clear air).},

We exploit a granular description of snow to develop a discrete element model based on the full 3-D microstructure captured by microtomography. The model assumes that snow is composed of rigid grains interacting through localized contacts accounting for cohesion and friction. The geometry of the grains and of the intergranular bonding system are explicitly defined from microtomographic data using geometrical criteria based on curvature and contiguity. Single grains are represented as rigid clumps of spheres. The model is applied to different snow samples subjected to confined compression tests. A detailed sensitivity analysis shows that artifacts introduced by the modeling approach and the influence of numerical parameters are limited compared to variations due to the geometry of the microstructure. The model shows that the compression behavior of snow is mainly controlled by the density of the samples, but that deviations from a pure density parameterization are not insignificant during the first phase of deformation. In particular, the model correctly predicts that, for a given density, faceted crystals are less resistant to compression than rounded grains or decomposed snow. For larger compression strains, no clear differences between snow types are observed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The deposition of light-absorbing particles (LAPs) such as mineral dust and black carbon on snow is responsible for a highly effective climate forcing, through darkening of the snow surface and associated feedbacks. The interplay between post-depositional snow transformation (metamorphism) and the dynamics of LAPs in snow remains largely unknown. We obtained time series of X-ray tomography images of dust-contaminated snow exposed to various metamorphic conditions. They 5 provide the first observational evidence that temperature gradient metamorphism induces dust particle motion in snow, while no movement is observed under isothermal conditions. Under temperature gradient metamorphism, dust particles can enter the ice matrix due to sublimation-condensation processes and spread down mainly by falling into the pore space. Overall, such motions might reduce the radiative impact of dust in snow, in particular in the Arctic where temperature gradient metamorphism prevails.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges that limit the amount of information that can be inferred from radar measurements of ice and mixed-phase precipitating clouds is the variability in ice mass within hydrometeors. The variable amount of ice mass within particles of a given size drives further variability in single-scattering properties that results in uncertainties of forward-modeled remote sensing quantities. Nonspherical ice-phase hydrometeors are often approximated as spheroids to simplify the calculation of single-scattering properties, yet offline calculations remain necessary to quantify these radiative properties as a function of size in discrete increments. In this paper, a simple scaling of the Clausius\textendash Mossotti factor is used that allows for an approximation of the scattering and extinction cross sections for an arbitrary mass\textendash dimensional power-law relationship of a nonspherical particle given a single T-matrix calculation. Using data collected by the University of Wyoming King Air in snow clouds over the Colorado Park Range, the uncertainty in forwardmodeled radar reflectivity to assumptions regarding mass\textendash dimensional relationships is examined. This is accomplished by taking advantage of independently measured condensed mass and particle size distributions to estimate the variability of the prefactor in the mass\textendash dimensional power law. Then, calculating the partial derivative of the radar backscatter cross sections using the scaling relationships, an estimate is made of the statistical uncertainty in forward-modeled radar reflectivity. Uncertainties on the order of 4 dB are found in this term for the dataset considered.},

Although known to be useful for characterizing damage in many other materials, the use of micro-CT has not yet been adapted to the non-trivial case of also characterizing damage in polycrystalline ice. Samples of polycrystalline ice were tested in uniaxial compression at six different strain rates, spanning four orders of magnitude, from 1~\texttimes ~10-6~s-1 to 1~\texttimes ~10-3~s-1, and two different testing temperatures of~-10~\textdegree C and~-20~\textdegree C. The extent of cracking from each test is characterized via micro-CT imaging and is quantified via a newly proposed variant of the crack density tensor, which accounts for any anisotropy in the mean crack orientation and is shown to be equivalent to the materials anisotropy tensor. To account for anisotropy in the distribution of cracks, an eigenanalysis is also performed. The results show that micro-CT can be a useful tool for both visualizing and quantifying damage in polycrystalline ice and that a 3-D analog of the traditional second-rank crack density tensor can be readily calculated via commercially available software.},

Parametric models can be used to calculate a for faceted growth as long as characteristic supersaturation schar values are known. However, previously published measurements of schar are limited to temperatures higher than 2408C. Estimates of schar at temperatures between 2408 and 2708C are provided here through reanalysis of vapor growth data. The estimated schar follow the same functional temperature dependence as data taken at higher temperatures. Polynomial fits to schar are used as inputs to a parameterization of a suitable for use in cloud models. Comparisons of the parameterization with wind tunnel data show that growth at liquid saturation and constant temperatures between 238 and 2208C can be modeled by ledge nucleation for larger (hundreds of micrometers) crystals; however, comparisons with free-fall chamber data at 278C suggest that dislocation growth may be required to model the vapor growth of small crystals (;20 mm) at liquid saturation. The comparisons with free-fall chamber data also show that the parameterization can reproduce the measured pressure dependence of aspect-ratio evolution. Comparisons with a hexagonal growth model indicate that aspect-ratio evolution based on the theory of Chen and Lamb produces unrealistically fast column growth near 278C that is mitigated if a theory based on faceted growth is used. This result indicates that the growth hypothesis used in habit-evolving microphysical models needs to be revised when deposition coefficients are predicted.},

In treating the stochastic motions of the diffusion of this same body, however, the center of diffusion (CD) is the appropriate origin. For an irregularlyshaped macromolecule, the CR and CD generally do not coincide with one another or with the center of mass (CM). The CR is that point at which the translation-rotation coupling resistance tensor is symmetric and at which the trace of the rotational resistance tensor is a minimum. The CD, defined as that point where the translation-rotation coupling diffusion tensor is symmetric, is the point at which the trace of the translational diffusion tensor is a minimum; the macroscopic translational diffusion coefficient corresponds to the value calculated there. Expressions are given for the transformation of the various tensors from one coordinate system to another. These equations are used to derive formulas for the locations of the CR and CD. One example is treated, a bent rigid rod composed of two arms each of length L. When the angle between the arms is 90\textdegree, the distance between the CR and the CD is 0.03L. The physical basis for the origin dependenceof the resistance and diffusion coefficientsis discussed, as is the reason that the CM, CR, and CD are generally distinct points.},

Besides, if the interface is reactive, it can form an intermediate recrystallized or amorphous region, and extra influencing phenomena are introduced. Reactive force field Molecular Dynamics (ReaxFF MD) is used to study these interfacial phenomena at the (non-)reactive interface. The non-reactive interfaces are compared using a phenomenological theory (PT), predicting the temperature discontinuity at the interface. By connecting ReaxFF MD and PT we confirm a continuous temperature profile for the homogeneous non-reactive interface and a temperature jump in case of the heterogeneous non-reactive interface. ReaxFF MD is further used to understand the effect of chemical activity of two solids in contact. The selected Si/SiO2 materials showed that the TBR of the reacted interface is two times larger than the non-reactive, going from     1.65 \&times;  10  \&minus; 9       to     3.38 \&times;  10  \&minus; 9       m2K/W. This is linked to the formation of an intermediate amorphous layer induced by heating, which remains stable when the system is cooled again. This provides the possibility to design multi-layered structures with a desired TBR.},

The accurate prediction of spatial patterns of wet-snow in mountainous terrain therefore has practical applications in both back-country avalanche forecasting and hydrology. Recent research has shown that incident radiation plays a dominant role during the first complete wetting of the snow cover. We therefore investigated if largescale meteorological forecast data, corrected for subgrid topographic influences on the shortwave radiation balance, together with subgrid mean slopes, can be combined to predict large-scale wet-snow avalanche patterns. Required surface albedo was derived from parameterized snow-covered fraction based on terrain parameters and measured flat field snow depths. We derived avalanche probability density functions for daily mean air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation from detailed observations over six winters using time-lapse photography. Based on probability density functions of these meteorological parameters and of slope angles of previous avalanches, we computed wet-snow probability maps for the entire Swiss Alps at a 2.5 km resolution. The probability maps compared well with observed wet-snow avalanche activity patterns. Even though the approach cannot forecast the onset of a cycle, since this would require snow cover related parameters, it provides a new approach toward an automatic spatial avalanche forecast built upon simple terrain parameters and easy to obtain large-scale meteorological surface variables. The advantage of our method is that it does not require running small-scale models with demanding model input parameters.},

As the gravitational effect has not been neglected in the theoretical model, the liquid interface profile is nonsymmetrical around the X-axis. Symmetry in the interface profile only occurs when either the particle size ratio or the gravitational force becomes zero. In this paper, some equations are derived as a function of the spheres' sizes, gap width, liquid density, surface tension and body force ( gravity/centrifugal) to estimate the maximum amount of liquid that can be held between the two solid spheres. Then a comparison is made between the result based on these equations and several experimental results.},

In this study, laboratory measurements of the terminal velocity yt for a variety of ice particle models settling in viscous fluids, along with wind-tunnel and field measurements of ice particles settling in air, have been analyzed and compared to common methods of computing yt from the literature. It is observed that while these methods work well for a number of particle types, they fail for particles with open geometries, specifically those particles for which the area ratio Ar is small (Ar is defined as the area of the particle projected normal to the flow divided by the area of a circumscribing disc). In particular, the fall speeds of stellar and dendritic crystals, needles, open bullet rosettes, and low-density aggregates are all overestimated. These particle types are important in many cloud types: aggregates in particular often dominate snow precipitation at the ground and vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements.},

The dense fluid mixture, which is generated at the fluid-fluid interface, leads to the onset of a convective fingering instability and triggers a fast chemical dissolution reaction. Contrary to intuition, the dissolution pattern does not map out the finger geometry. Instead, it displays a dome-like, hierarchical structure that follows the path of the ascending fluid interface and the regions of maximum mixing. These mixing and reaction hot spots coincide with the flow stagnation points, at which the interfacial mixing layer is compressed and deformed. We show that the deformation of the boundary layer around the stagnation points controls the evolution of the global scalar dissipation and reaction rates and shapes the structure of the reacted zones. The persistent compression of the mixing layer explains the independence of the mixing rate from the Rayleigh number when convection dominates.},

Darcy\textendash Buckingham's law and the van Genuchten model were used to simulate water movement. Parameters for the van Genuchten model were determined as functions of snow density and grain size, based on a previous gravity drainage column experiment. Water entry suction was newly incorporated to simulate liquid water infiltrating dry snow, based on the results of a previous capillary pressure experiment. Heterogeneity of grain size and snow density were also implemented. Heterogeneity alone was not sufficient for the development of preferential flow paths. When both water entry suction and heterogeneity were implemented, the model could simulate the formation of a preferential flow path. Validation of the simulation results by comparison with the results of a previous laboratory experiment showed that the simulated preferential flow path reproduced the experimental result fairly well. The size of the preferential flow path was negatively correlated with grain size and positively correlated with the water supply rate in both the simulation and the experiment. Comparison of the time series of suction between the simulation and the experimental result suggested that some additional measurements need to be obtained experimentally to improve the accuracy of the model. Sensitivity experiments showed that grain size and snow density heterogeneity affected both the size of the preferential flow path and the arrival time of liquid water at the snow base. These results suggest that more measurements of small-scale spatial variability in natural snow are needed to improve the model.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo particle transport applications are often written in low-level languages (C/C++) for optimal performance on clusters and supercomputers. However, this development approach often sacrifices straightforward usability and testing in the interest of fast application performance. To improve usability, some high-performance computing applications employ mixed-language programming with high-level and low-level languages. In this study, we consider the benefits of incorporating an interactive Python interface into a Monte Carlo application. With PyMercury, a new Python extension to the Mercury general-purpose Monte Carlo particle transport code, we improve application usability without diminishing performance. In two case studies, we illustrate how PyMercury improves usability and simplifies testing and validation in a Monte Carlo application. In short, PyMercury demonstrates the value of interactive Python for Monte Carlo particle transport applications. In the future, we expect interactive Python to play an increasingly significant role in Monte Carlo usage and testing.},

  abstract = {Sizes and shapes of snow particles were determined from X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT) images, and their single-scattering properties were calculated at visible and near-infrared wavelengths using a Geometrical Optics Method (GOM). We analyzed seven snow samples including fresh and aged artificial snow and natural snow obtained from field samples. Individual snow particles were numerically extracted, and the shape of each snow particle was defined by applying a rendering method. The size distribution and specific surface area distribution were estimated from the geometrical properties of the snow particles, and an effective particle radius was derived for each snow sample. The GOM calculations at wavelengths of 0.532 and 1.242 {$\mu$}m revealed that the realistic snow particles had similar scattering phase functions as those of previously modeled irregular shaped particles. Furthermore, distinct dendritic particles had a characteristic scattering phase function and asymmetry factor. The single-scattering properties of particles of effective radius reff were compared with the size-averaged single-scattering properties. We found that the particles of reff could be used as representative particles for calculating the average single-scattering properties of the snow. Furthermore, the single-scattering properties of the micro-CT particles were compared to those of particle shape models using our current snow retrieval algorithm. For the single-scattering phase function, the results of the micro-CT particles were consistent with those of a conceptual two-shape model. However, the particle size dependence differed for the single-scattering albedo and asymmetry factor.},

Yet, due to their complex geometry with several sharp regions which are singular for the evaporation, the precise evaporation dynamics of snow and ice crystals remains challenging to predict. Here, we study the sublimation of snowflakes and pointy ice drops. We show that the evaporation rates of water and ice drops are similar; they are both limited by the diffusive transport of the vapour. This allows us to predict ice and snowflake evaporation quantitatively by solving the diffusive free-boundary problem, which correctly~predicts the rapid self-similar evolution of sharp edges and points. Beyond providing a conceptual picture to understand the sublimation of ice crystals, our results are more generally applicable to other diffusion problems such as the dissolution of salt crystals or pharmaceuticals.},

  abstract = {The reliable evaluation of moisture transfer in porous materials is essential in many engineering applications, among which building science. One key aspect is a correct description of moisture flow phenomena and their transport potentials. While different issues can be debated in that respect, thermal diffusion of water vapour in porous materials \textendash{} diffusion driven by temperature gradients \textendash{} currently stands out, due to the contradictory findings on the topic. Thermal diffusion proponents uphold that, complementary to vapour pressure gradients, temperature gradients equally yield substantial diffusion. Thermal diffusion opponents, on the other hand, assert that these thermal transports are negligibly small. This paper resolves that contradiction. A critical analysis of the investigations supporting the occurrence of thermal diffusion reveals that all are flawed. A correct reinterpretation of all measurements allows concluding that no consistent nor significant thermal diffusion can be observed. This brings these investigations in line with their earlier opponents. This conclusion also agrees with thermodynamics, which confirms the actual existence of thermal diffusion, but also indicates its negligible magnitude. It can in conclusion be stated that thermal diffusion is of no importance for building science applications, leaving vapour pressure as the sole significant transport potential for the diffusion of water vapour in porous materials.},

  abstract = {Developing a better understanding of single-/multiphase flow through reservoir rocks largely relies on characterizing and modeling the pore system. For simple homogeneous rock materials, a complete description of the real pore structure can be obtained from the pore network extracted from a rock image at a single resolution, and then an accurate prediction of fluid flow properties can be achieved by using network model. However, for complex rocks (e.g., carbonates, heterogeneous sandstones, deformed rocks), a comprehensive description of the real pore structure may involve several decades of length scales (e.g., from submicron to centimeters), which cannot be captured by a single-resolution image due to the restriction of image size and resolution. Hence, the reconstruction of a single 3-D multiple-scale model of a porous medium is an important step in quantitatively characterizing such heterogeneous rocks and predicting their multiphase flow properties. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for the numerical construction of the multiscale pore structure of a complex rock from a number of CT images/models of a carbonate sample at several length scales. The success of this reconstruction relies heavily on image segmentation, pore network extraction and stochastic network generation, which are provided by our existing software system, referred to as Pore Analysis Tools (PAT). Specifically, the statistical description of pore networks of 3-D rock images at multiple resolutions makes it possible for us to: (a) construct an arbitrary sized network which is equivalent in a specified domain, and (b) integrate multiple networks of different sizes into a single network incorporating all scales. Using multiscale networks of carbonate rocks generated in this manner, two-phase network modeling results are presented to show how the resulting flow properties are dependent on inclusion of information from multiple scales. These outcomes reinforce the importance of capturing both geometry and topology in the hierarchical pore structure for such complex pore systems. The example presented reveals that isolated large-scale (e.g., macro-) pores are mainly connected by small-scale (e.g., micro-) pores, which in turn determines the combined effective petrophysical properties (capillary pressure, absolute and relative permeability). It is also demonstrated that multi- (three) scale networks reveal the effects of the interacting multiscale pore systems (e.g., micropores, macropores, and vugs) on bulk flow properties in terms of two-phase flow properties.},

A whole configuration and set-up were developed specifically for the study of unsaturated Hostun sand and its water retention behaviour, using X-ray CT. A ``step-by-step'' protocol to obtain reconstructed volumes of sufficient quality where the three phases of the specimen can be clearly distinguished (i.e., grain, water and air) was also presented. A post-processing of the images helped the visualization and the characterization of the three phases within the specimen. A region growing separation tool was used to obtain trinarized volumes, allowing a qualitative/quantitative analysis to be performed. A qualitative interpretation of the resulting images has been done focusing on the water retention domains, where images of each different domain were retrieved for different suction values. Later, local measurements of relevant soil variables were conducted for a chosen subvolume of {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} D50. This helped to build a map of measurement that covers the entire specimen field. Finally, water retention curve of Hostun sand was plotted and compared to a reference one. An investigation about the relation between the state variables: porosity and degree of saturation, for a constant suction, was performed. A noteworthy trend between porosity and degree of saturation was identified and discussed. The analysis presented in this study could be adapted for other granular materials, combined with pore size distribution and pore shape description, in order to understand the local relation between water retention behaviour characteristics and build a model that covers the whole retention behaviour of unsaturated granular materials.},

  abstract = {The sublimation rate of ice is commonly calculated using the simple Hertz\textendash Knudsen formula. This formula is derived from the kinetic theory of gases and ignores microphysical processes determining the actual sublimation rate. The microphysical processes can be accounted for by including the temperature dependent sublimation coefficient (Kossacki, K.J., et al. [1999]. Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1521\textendash 1530; Gundlach, B., Skorov, Y.V., Blum, J. [2011]. Icarus 213, 710\textendash 719). Kossacki and Markiewicz (Kossacki, K.J., Markiewicz, W.J. [2013]. Icarus 224, 172\textendash 177) discussed to what extent inaccuracy of the simple Hertz\textendash Knudsen equation affects the calculated temperature of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Numerical simulations presented in Kossacki and Markiewicz (Kossacki, K.J., Markiewicz, W.J. [2013]. Icarus 224, 172\textendash 177) indicate, that derivation of the temperature below the dust mantle from the measured water production rate ignoring temperature dependence of the sublimation coefficient can lead to an underestimate of the temperature by more than 10K. Thus, it is important to know the dependence on the sublimation coefficient of the composition of the real cometary ice, which can be far from purity. We intended to check whether a small amount of dissolved minerals can affect the temperature dependence of the sublimation coefficient of ice. According to our experiments the answer is positive.},

The transport rates through the individual pathways of the pore network are determined by the local width of the pore channels and by the driving mechanism. The model objects represent quasi two-dimensional random site percolation clusters. The calculated design was realized by milling the structure in polystyrene sheets. Velocity maps of stationary flow and current density maps of stationary currents through the cluster were acquired by magnetic resonance imaging methods. The findings were compared to the results of numerical simulations based on the same structure. Since the difference in the transport patterns of the different driving mechanisms are expected to be more pronounced in smaller pore spaces, ultra deep X-ray lithography has been used for the fabrication of downsized model objects with a spatial resolution of better than 50 mm and an aspect ratio as large as 20. First results obtained with these objects are reported.},

  abstract = {Snow microstructure and its evolution play an important role for various applications of snow physics in cryospheric sciences. The main modes of microstructure evolution in snow are referred to as isothermal and temperature gradient metamorphism. The former describes the coarsening driven by interfacial energy while the latter is dominated by recrystallization processes induced by temperature gradients. An accurate description of these processes in snowpack models is of key importance. However common snowpack models are still based on traditional grain metrics, originally tailored to field observations, and empirical evolution laws. This treatment of snow microstructure is essentially unrelated to recent advances of snow observations by microcomputed tomography (\^I\OE CT). The present thesis contributes to the solution of this problem by i) identifying suitable microstructure parameters ii) deriving evolution equations for these from first principles and iii) developing methods that allow to utilize 4D \^I\OE CT measurements of snow as a link between local ice crystal growth and upscaled microstructure as relevant on the scales of interest for common snowpack models. To this end, three studies have been conducted. The first study focuses on estimating local ice-crystal growth rates from interface tracking by analyzing 4D \^I\OE CT data of in-situ snow metamorphism experiments under isothermal and temperature gradient conditions. For temperature gradient metamorphism diffusion-limited growth is considered, while for isothermal metamorphism the data is compared to kinetics and diffusion limited growth. Despite considerable scatter, in both cases the significance of underlying growth laws could be statistically confirmed. The second study uses \^I\OE CT images from a variety of snow samples to investigate the role of grain shape in the context of microwave and optical properties of snow. Grain shape can be objectively defined via size-dispersity of structure from the second moment of either the mean curvature distribution or the chord-length distribution. In addition, a quantitative link between these quantities and the exponential correlation length is shown. The latter is relevant for parameterizing macroscopic properties such as microwave scattering coefficients, dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity. Finally, a rigorous, upscaled microstructure scheme is developed by deriving mathematically exact evolution equations for the density, specific surface area, the mean and Gaussian curvature and the second moment of mean curvature. The microstructural evolution is driven by local ice crystal growth. All parameters are upscaled by volume averaging and the correctness of the model is confirmed for the time evolution of idealized grains. The model can be compared to 4D \^I\OE CT data without any a-priori assumptions. This benchmarking reveals the uncertainties of the interface tracking method which are largely caused by limited temporal and spatial resolution. The model allows to statistically assess the validity of ice crystal growth laws during snow metamorphism. For a temperature gradient experiment it is shown that a diffusion limited growth law is not consistent with the observed decay of the specific surface area. The developed model is a powerful and rigorous tool that is tailored to 4D \^I\OE CT data. It connects microscale ice-crystal growth thermodynamics with the macroscale snowpack modeling.},

  abstract = {Presently a unified treatment of microstructure dynamics in terrestrial snow from principles of ice crystal growth is hindered by the lack of models for the evolution of the bicontinuous ice matrix. To this end we developed a rigorous microstructure upscaling scheme which is based on common pore-scale (vapor diffusion) principles of crystal growth to predict the averaged evolution of the interface morphology. We derived a coupled set of evolution equations for the (volume averaged) ice volume fraction, surface area per unit volume, Gaussian curvature and first and second moment of the mean curvature distribution and demonstrate their correctness by a comparison to interface tracking of idealized grains. In a second step we use the model as a benchmark tool without a priori assumptions for a comparison to experiments of snow microstructure evolution via image analysis on 4D X-ray tomography data. The benchmarking allows quantifying uncertainties from local estimates of crystal growth velocities. Finally we demonstrate how the rigorous model facilitates a statistical assessment of common growth laws by combining 4D microstructure data with finite element numerics. The results show that the prediction of the surface area evolution from first principles demands further conceptual insight from ice crystal growth.},

  abstract = {The surface area of snow that is accessible to gases is an essential parameter for quantifying the exchange of trace gases between the snowpack and the atmosphere and is called the specific surface area (SSA). Snow SSA decreases during metamorphism, but this is not described in current snow models owing to the complexity of the physics and geometry of snow. In this paper, we test whether it is possible to model snow SSA changes during isothermal metamorphism without accounting for all the complexity of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of real snow. We have developed a mean field model of snow metamorphism under isothermal conditions, grounded in the theoretical framework of transient Ostwald ripening and representing snow as a distribution of spherical particles. Analytical expressions of the growth rates of these spheres are obtained, and the evolution of two measurable parameters that characterize snow geometry, the SSA and the distribution of radii of curvature (DRC), are simulated and compared to experimental data obtained by X-ray tomography. The qualitative effects of temperature, snow density, and the condensation coefficient on the rate of SSA decrease are examined. The model predicts very well the rate of evolution of the particle size distribution, which validates our physical description of isothermal metamorphism. In particular, we find that vapor phase diffusion is rate limiting. However, the calculation of the SSA from the DRC appears delicate and evidences too crude approximations in our description of the 3-D geometry of snow. Finally, it is stressed that the initial DRC can greatly influence the rate of SSA decrease, while experimental measurements of the rate of SSA decrease suggest that all snow types evolve in a similar way. It is thus proposed that most natural fresh snows have similar DRCs.},

The governing equation for draining foam (or a soil variant termed the soil foam drainage equation\textemdash SFDE) obviates the need for macroscopic unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function by an explicit account of diminishing flow pathway sizes as the medium gradually drains. The study provides new and simple analytical expressions for drainage rates and volumes from unsaturated porous media subjected to different boundary conditions. Two novel analytical solutions for saturation profile evolution were derived and tested in good agreement with a numerical solution of the SFDE. The study and the proposed solutions rectify the original formulation of foam drainage dynamics of Or and Assouline (2013). The new framework broadens the scope of methods available for quantifying unsaturated flow in porous media, where the intrinsic conductivity and geometrical representation of capillary drainage could improve understanding of colloid and pathogen transport. The explicit geometrical interpretation of flow pathways underlying the hydraulic functions used by the Richards equation offers new insights that benefit both approaches.},

  abstract = {The snow cover model SNOWPACK includes a detailed model of snow microstructure and metamorphism. In SNOWPACK, the complex texture of snow is described using the four primary microstructure parameters: grain size, bond size, dendricity and sphericity. For each parameter, rate equations are developed that predict the development in time as a function of the environmental conditions. The rate equations are based on theoretical considerations such as mixture theory and on empirical relations. With a classification scheme, the conventional snow grain types are predicted on the basis of those parameters. The approach to link the bulk constitutive properties, viscosity and thermal conductivity to microstructure parameters is novel to the field of snow cover modeling. Expanding on existing knowledge on microstructure-based viscosity and thermal conductivity, a complete description of those quantities applicable to the seasonal snow cover is presented. This includes the strong coupling between physical processes in snow: The bond size, which changes not only through metamorphic processes but also through the process of pressure sintering (included in our viscosity formulation), is at the same time the single most important parameter for snow viscosity and thermal conductivity. Laboratory results are used to illustrate the performance of the formulations presented. The numerical implementation is treated in the companion paper Part I. A more complete evaluation for the entire model is found in the companion paper Part III.},

  abstract = {The development of the seasonal snow cover is entirely driven by atmospheric forcing. SNOWPACK uses measured snow depths to determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent heat flux parameterizations are derived from Monin \textendash{} Obukhov similarity and include a formulation for wind pumping. The formulations will also adapt to drifting snow conditions. The new suggestion is consistent with the observation of different roughness lengths for scalars and momentum over snow. An accurate formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface hoar, a very important weak layer. We also account for the effect of wind pumping on the thermal conductivity in the uppermost snow layers. The surface energy and mass exchange formulations are evaluated by looking at the formation of the important thin layers surface hoar and melt \textendash{} freeze crusts in SNOWPACK. Those layers are well simulated. In addition, the complete snow profile development is modeled successfully for the parameters grain type, temperature, density, grain size and liquid water content. An overall score between 0 and 1 is used to describe the profile agreement with observations and an average score of over 0.8 is reached.},

To this end we propose a minimal empirical model to describe the temporal evolution of the structural anisotropy and publish the extensive, calibration dataset consisting of meteorological, radar, and micro computer tomography (CT) data. The dataset was acquired 5 near the town of Sodankyl\"a in Northern Finland. The model is tailored to immediate implementation into common snow pack models driven by meteorological data as its parametrization is solely based on macroscopic, thermodynamic fields. Here we use output data of the physical model SNOWPACK to drive our model. The model implements rate equations for each snow layer and accounts for snow settling and temperature gradient metamorphism, which are taken to be the main drivers of the temporal evolution of the structural anisotropy. The model is calibrated with available time series of anisotropy measurements 10 spanning four different winter seasons. The calibration measurements were obtained from polarimetric radar data which were analyzed with respect to the dielectric anisotropy of snow. From the detailed comparison between simulated anisotropy and radar time series we identify settling as the main mechanism causing horizontal structures in the snow pack. The comparison also confirms temperature gradient metamorphism as the main mechanism for vertical structures. For validation of the model we use full-depth profiles of anisotropy measurements obtained from CT data. The results show that the model can predict 15 the measured CT profiles quite accurately. For depth hoar, differences between modeled anisotropy and the anisotropy derived from exponential correlation lengths are observed and discussed in view of potential limitations.},

We compare regional climate model simulations at 27 and 5.5 km resolution for the year 2009. The wind speed maxima in Terre Ade\textasciiacute lie and the narrow glacial valleys of Victoria Land are better represented at 5.5 km resolution, because the topography is better resolved. Drifting snow sublimation is {$>$}100 mm a-1 in regions with high wind speeds. Our results indicate a strong feedback between topography, wind gradients and drifting snow erosion. As a result, SMB shows much more local spatial variability at 5.5 km resolution that is controlled by drifting snow erosion, whereas the large-scale SMB gradient is largely determined by precipitation. Drifting snow processes lead to ablation in the narrow glacial valleys of Victoria Land. The integrated SMB equals 86 Gt. Although wind climate, drifting snow processes and SMB variability are better represented at 5.5 km, the area-integrated SMB is not significantly different between the simulations at 27 and 5.5 km. A horizontal resolution of 27 km is sufficient to realistically simulate ice-sheet wide SMB.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of the amount and timing of water flux through melting snowpacks is important for runoff prediction in cold regions. Most existing snowmelt models only account for one-dimensional matrix flow and neglect to simulate the formation of preferential flow paths. Consideration of lateral and preferential flows has proven critical to improve the performance of soil and groundwater porous media flow models. A two-dimensional physically-based snowpack model that simulates snowmelt, refreezing of meltwater, heat and water flows, and preferential flow paths is presented. The model assumes thermal equilibrium between solid and liquid phases and uses recent snow physics advances to estimate snowpack hydraulic and thermal properties. For the first time, capillary hysteresis is accounted in a snowmelt model. A finite volume method is applied to solve for the 2D coupled heat and mass transfer equations. The model with capillary hysteresis provided better simulations of water suction at the wet to dry snow interface in a wetting snow sample than did a model that only accounted for the boundary drying curve. Capillary hysteresis also improved simulations of preferential flow path dynamics and the snowpack discharge hydrograph. Simulating preferential flow in a subfreezing snowpack allowed the model to generate ice layers, and increased the vertical exchange of energy, thus modelling a faster warming of the snowpack than would be possible without preferential flow. The model is thus capable of simulating many attributes of heterogeneous natural melting snowpacks. These features not only qualitatively improve water flow simulations, but improve the understanding of snowmelt flow processes for both level and sloping terrain, and illuminate how uncertainty in snowmelt-derived runoff calculations might be reduced through the inclusion of more realistic preferential flow through snowpacks.},

The bubble growth is characterized by a pattern transition between an invasion percolation (IP) pattern in a first phase of the growth and an invasion percolation in a destabilizing gradient (IPDG) at later times. It is shown that this transition corresponds at the pore scale to a transition between an invasion scenario where only one pore is invaded at each step of the invasion and a multiple pore invasion scenario. The IPDG pattern is characterized by the development of a thin vapour finger, which can explain premature vapour breakthroughs. This type of vapour finger cannot be simulated accurately using traditional models based on the continuum approach to porous media.},

Towards a remedy, we address the effective thermal conductivity tensor of snow via anisotropic, secondorder bounds. The bound provides an explicit expression for the thermal conductivity and predicts the relevance of a microstructural anisotropy parameter Q, which is given by an integral over the two-point correlation function and unambiguously defined for arbitrary snow structures. For validation we compiled a comprehensive data set of 167 snow samples.

  abstract = {Finding relevant microstructural parameters beyond density is a longstanding problem which hinders the formulation of accurate parameterizations of physical properties of snow. Towards a remedy, we address the effective thermal conductivity tensor of snow via anisotropic, secondorder bounds. The bound provides an explicit expression for the thermal conductivity and predicts the relevance of a microstructural anisotropy parameter Q, which is given by an integral over the two-point correlation function and unambiguously defined for arbitrary snow structures. For validation we compiled a comprehensive data set of 167 snow samples. The set comprises individual samples of various snow types and entire time series of metamorphism experiments under isothermal and temperature gradient conditions. All samples were digitally reconstructed by micro-computed tomography to perform microstructure-based simulations of heat transport. The incorporation of anisotropy via Q considerably reduces the root mean square error over the usual density-based parameterization.

  abstract = {A constitutive theory of snow is developed to describe the mechanical properties of snow in terms of the properties of the ice grains and the necks that interconnect them. The principle of virtual work is used to calculate the stresses in the particles and necks. A number of different deformation mechanisms are investigated and, depending upon the deformation mechanism which is dominant for given load conditions, different equations are used to calculate the strains in the grains and necks. These strains around a representative ice grain are then averaged and scaled to obtain the global strains in the snow. The theory is then compared with experimental data to determine if the mechanical properties of snow can be adequately represented. Results show that the constitutive theory does work, but that it is cumbersome to implement, and that for practical use substantial computational capability is needed.},

A series of NMR spectroscopy experiments were conducted to measure the effect of electroosmotic pressure on dispersion in packed spheres as a function of diameter and electric field strength. The experiments confirm earlier observations by others of superdiffusive transport in closed media. However, superdiffusive behavior is observed even at small pore sizes, contrary to earlier results and simulations in fixed sphere packs, and is conjectured to result from pressure-induced rearrangement of the particles. Simulations also support the existence of pore size-independent velocity distributions in closed media. The distribution of reverse velocities is also similar, apart from a difference in sign, to pressure-driven flow in open porous media.},

  abstract = {Core Ideas Evaporative drying of soil columns was monitored in high resolution using NMR. Soil moisture data were used for validating a water, vapor, and heat flow model. The Richards approach was insufficient under Stage II conditions. NMR is a feasible technique for soil moisture measurements under Stage II conditions. Evaporation from bare soil surfaces can be restrained to a great extent with the development of a dry layer at the soil surface where capillary hydraulic conductance ceases and water flow proceeds only by gas phase transport. Model calculations and preliminary experiments with model porous media have shown that this surface layer can be very thin. An accurate characterization of these processes is required, which is provided by noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) methods. The evaporative drying of a silt loam and a sandy loam was monitored at high spatial resolution in laboratory experiments. The MR data were used to assess the performance of two numerical models: (i) the Richards equation, which considers isothermal liquid water flow, and (ii) a coupled soil water, heat, and vapor flow numerical model. The experimental results reveal two distinct drying regimes for both soil types where, at the onset of the second evaporation stage, a dry surface zone developed with increasing thickness over time. This layer revealed that water loss inside the soil coincided with a relatively low evaporation rate as the liquid continuity to the soil surface vanished. The modeling results clearly demonstrated the need to consider heat and vapor flow. It was shown, as a proof of principle, that MR relaxation time spectra may serve as a proxy to follow desaturation processes where spatially resolved transverse relaxation can reveal a secondary evaporation front.},

  abstract = {Dry snow metamorphism has traditionally been classified by the thermal environment encountered in the snowpack. Snow experiencing a predominantly macroscopically isothermal environment develops a different microstructure than snow that is subjected to a significant temperature gradient. As such, previous research has evaluated snow metamorphism based upon select thermal gradient-dependent processes, when in reality, there is a continuum of physical processes simultaneously contributing to metamorphism. In previous research, a discrete temperature-gradient transition between the two thermal environments has been used to activate separate morphological analyses. The current research focuses on a unifying approach to dry snow metamorphism that is applicable to generalized thermal environments. The movement of heat and mass is not prescribed, but is allowed to develop naturally through modeling of physical processes. Equilibrium forms and the transition to kinetic growth are considered with this model. Metamorphism predictions under macroscopically isothermal conditions are presented followed by a definition for the transition to kinetic growth. Density, grain size, bond size, and temperature dependencies are each examined in an isothermal metamorphism environment. The same physical model is then used to define a smooth transition between isothermal and temperature gradient environments. Microstructural and environmental parameters that influence transition to kinetic growth are examined. The correlation with established trends and experiments in each environment is excellent. The microstructural model is a new tool capable of evaluating metamorphism for a broad range of microstructural parameters and thermal environments.},

  abstract = {Micro/nanomachines capable of propulsion through fluidic environments provide diverse opportunities in important biomedical applications. In this paper, we present a theoretical study on micromotors steered through liquid by an external rotating magnetic field. A purely geometric tight upper bound on the propulsion speed normalized with field frequency, known as propulsion efficiency, {$\delta$}, for an arbitrarily shaped object is derived. Using this bound, we estimate the maximum propulsion efficiency of previously reported random magnetic aggregates. We introduce a complementary definition of the propulsion efficiency, {$\delta$}*, that ranks propellers according to their maximal speed in body lengths per unit time and that appears to be preferable over the standard definition in a search for fastest machines. Using a bead-based hydrodynamic model combined with genetic algorithms, we determine that {$\delta$}*-optimal propeller deviates strongly from the bioinspired slim helix and has a surprising chubby skew-symmetric shape. It is also shown that optimized propellers with preprogrammed shape are substantially more efficient than random magnetic aggregates. We anticipate that the results of the present study will provide guidance toward prospective experimental design of more efficient magnetic micro/nanomachines.},

  abstract = {Ice sintering is a form of metamorphism that drives the microstructural evolution of an aggregate of grains through surface and volume diffusion. This leads to an increase in the grain-to-grain contact area ("neck") and density of the aggregate over time, resulting in the evolution of its strength, porosity, thermal conductivity, and other properties. This process plays an important role in the evolution of icy planetary surfaces, though its rate and nature are not well constrained. In this study, we explore the model of Swinkels and Ashby (1981), and assess the extent to which it can be used to quantify sintering timescales for water ice. We compare predicted neck growth rates to new and historical observations of ice sintering, and find agreement to some studies at the order of magnitude level. First-order estimates of neck growth timescales on planetary surfaces show that ice may undergo significant modification over geologic timescales, even in the outer solar system. Densification occurs over much longer timescales, suggesting some surfaces may develop cohesive, but porous, crusts. Sintering rates are extremely sensitive to temperature and grain size, occurring faster in warmer aggregates of smaller grains. This suggests that the microstructural evolution of ices may vary not only throughout the solar system, but also spatially across the surface and in the near-surface of a given body. Our experimental observations of complex grain growth and mass redistribution in ice aggregates point to components of the model that may benefit from improvement, and areas where additional laboratory studies are needed.},

The diffusion approximation to the constant cross-section neutron transport equation is used to describe neutron flux in the snow and ice. Neutron flux in the access hole is described either by the diffusion approximation or by a transient approximation depending on the magnitude of the transport mean free path for neutrons in the borehole fluid. For ``dry,'' air-filled, access holes the transient solutions are most suitable. A theoretical calibration algorithm, relating snow density to the neutron count rate measured by a cylindrical detector (also centralized in the access hole) and the access hole diameter, is derived. A good fit to experimental data is obtained using values of the physically based parameters of the algorithm within ranges determined a priori from the literature and from manufacturer's specifications. A calibration equation fitted to output from the algorithm for T = -10\textdegree C is consistent with field data and shows that the accuracy and precision of density measurements made using the probe can match the accuracy and precision of field gravimetric methods, with the advantage of a continuous and unbiased sampling method.},

Two cases of midlatitude anvil cirrus forming under very similar environmental conditions are examined. The case studies benefit from simultaneous observations of vertical velocities in cirrus collected at and around the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site during the U.S. Department of Energy Small Particles in Cirrus field campaign. Observations from both platforms suggest that the majority of vertical velocities in the examined midlatitude anvil cirrus cases are roughly within {$\pm$}1 m s-1 although higher vertical velocities are occasionally observed. The quality of the vertical velocity comparison between in situ aircraft measurements and ground-based Doppler radar retrievals depends on the case. For the first case on 23 April 2010, the comparison suggests that the radar retrieval may underestimate vertical velocities in the range between roughly 50 cm s-1 and 1 m s-1. For the second case on 14 June 2010, the agreement between radar and aircraft is excellent, and the differences are largely within the observed variability of vertical velocities within cirrus. Differences in the spatial scales of vertical velocities and turbulence sampled by the aircraft and Doppler radar, which arise due to differences in the temporal resolution of the observational platforms are not found to explain the observed discrepancies. Estimates for the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy agree to within 1 order of magnitude between the two observational platforms.},

  abstract = {, The ice
premelt, often called the quasi-liquid layer (QLL), is
key for the lubrication of ice, gas uptake by ice, and growth of aerosols.
Despite its apparent importance, in-depth understanding of the ice
premelt from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale has not been
gained. By reviewing data obtained using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, and laser confocal differential
interference contrast microscopy (LCM-DIM), we provide a unified view
of the experimentally observed variation in quasi-liquid (QL) states.
In particular, we disentangle three distinct types of QL states of
disordered layers, QL-droplet, and QL-film and discuss their nature., The topmost ice layer is energetically unstable, as the topmost
interfacial H2O molecules lose a hydrogen bonding partner,
generating a disordered layer at the ice\textendash air interface. This
disordered layer is homogeneously distributed over the ice surface.
The nature of the disordered layer changes over a wide temperature
range from -90 \textdegree C to the bulk melting point. Combined
MD simulations and SFG measurements reveal that the topmost ice surface
starts to be disordered around -90 \textdegree C through a process
that the topmost water molecules with three hydrogen bonds convert
to a doubly hydrogen-bonded species. When the temperature is further
increased, the second layer starts to become disordered at around
-16 \textdegree C. This disordering occurs not in a gradual manner,
but in a bilayer-by-bilayer manner., When the temperature reaches
-2 \textdegree C, more complicated
structures, QL-droplet and QL-film, emerge on the top of the ice surface.
These QL-droplets and QL-films are inhomogeneously distributed, in
contrast to the disordered layer. We show that these QL-droplet and
QL-film emerge only under supersaturated/undersaturated vapor pressure
conditions, as partial and pseudopartial wetting states, respectively.
Experiments with precisely controlled pressure show that, near the
water vapor pressure at the vapor-ice equilibrium condition, no QL-droplet
and QL-film can be observed, implying that the QL-droplet and QL-film
emerge exclusively under nonequilibrium conditions, as opposed to
the disordered layers formed under equilibrium conditions., These
findings are connected with many phenomena related to the
ice surface. For example, we explain how the disordering of the topmost
ice surface governs the slipperiness of the ice surface, allowing
for ice skating. Further focus is on the gas uptake mechanism on the
ice surface. Finally, we note the unresolved questions and future
challenges regarding the ice premelt.},

  abstract = {Vadose water is subsurface water between the land surface and the saturated zone below the water table. The vadose (or unsaturated) zone includes soil water, which is immediately available to the biosphere. It acts as a controlling agent in the transmission of water and other substances between various components of the earth system: aquifers, land surface, bodies of water, atmosphere, and so on. As an accessible body of material near the earth's surface, the vadose zone is a focus of much human activity, including agriculture, mining, construction, and waste disposal. Thus, it is affected by anthropogenic modifications of its chemical and physical components. Modern hydrology must consider interactions not only among the natural constituents, but also with a wide variety of contaminants, including pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation wastewater, sewage, toxic chemicals, radioactive substances, bacteria, mine wastes, and organic liquids. The dynamics of vadose water are complicated by the presence of multiple phases. At least three drastically different substances \textendash{} water, air, and solid mineral \textendash{} are critical to vadose zone processes. Unsaturated flow phenomena are extremely sensitive to the proportions of those phases, especially the fluid phases, as natural variations in the relative amounts of water and air can cause a property like hydraulic conductivity to vary over many orders of magnitude. This article describes the main phenomena related to the state and dynamics of vadose water, including means of measuring or estimating the properties that affect vadose water. Further, it describes roles of vadose water in the hydrologic cycle.},

  abstract = {Simple models for transport through stochastic media usually assume that the chord lengths of materials are distributed exponentially. Theory predicts that, in a medium consisting of disks/spheres that can interpenetrate, chord lengths in the background material (between the disks/spheres) should exactly follow an exponential. In a medium with impenetrable (non-overlapping) disks/spheres, the distribution is only approximately exponential. This paper demonstrates, through direct numerical simulations, that for randomly distributed disks in 2D and spheres in 3D, with distributions of radii, chord lengths in the background material (between the disks/spheres) are accurately described by exponentials over five orders of magnitude when the material is dilute. The chord lengths inside the disks and spheres are not exponentially distributed, but those distributions can be calculated. A scaling relationship between the mean chord lengths in the two materials is presented for an infinite medium. By knowing the mean properties of the disks/spheres in a medium, this relationship allows one to accurately describe the statistical properties of the background material. The stochastic simulations are validated by this infinite medium relationship. When the fraction of space occupied by the disks or spheres becomes large, the distributions are no longer accurately described by an exponential.},

This is a two-phase flow configuration that is pertinent to thermal management solutions, where the fundamental flow physics have yet to be fully described. In this work, we present an experimental apparatus that enables high-quality Schlieren images for different bubble sizes and measurement planes. By combining these visualizations with an advanced bubble tracking technique, we can simultaneously quantify the symbiotic relationship that exists between the sliding bubble dynamics and its associated wake. An unstable, dynamic wake structure is revealed, consisting of multiple hairpin-shaped vortex structures interacting within the macroscopic area affected by the bubble. As vorticity is generated in the near wake, the bubble shape is observed to recoil and rebound. This also occurs normal to the surface and is particularly noticeable for larger bubble sizes, with a periodic ejection of material from the near wake corresponding to significant shape changes. These findings, along with their implications from a thermal management perspective, provide information on the rich dynamics of this natural flow that cannot be obtained using alternate experimental techniques.},

SAM combines together pristine columns with multiple dimensions to derive complex aggregates constrained to size-mass relationship obtained by data collected from in situ measurements. The model also simulates the melting processes occurring for environmental temperatures above 0\textdegree C and thus define the mixed-phase particles structure. The single-scattering properties of the modeled snowflakes (dry and mixed phased) are computed by using a discrete dipole approximation (DDA) algorithm which allows to model irregularly shaped targets. In case of mixed-phased particles, realistic radiative properties are obtained by assuming snow aggregates with a 10\% of melted fraction. The single-scattering properties are compared with those calculated through Mie theory together with Maxwell-Garnett effective medium approximation using both a homogeneous sphere and a layered-sphere models. The results show that for large-size parameters there are significant differences between the radiative properties calculated using complex microphysical and optical algorithms (i.e., SAM and DDA) and those obtained from simplified assumptions as the layered-sphere models (even when the radial ice density distribution of the aggregated snowflakes is perfectly matched). Finally, some applications to quantitative precipitation estimation using radar data are presented to show how the resulting differences in the basic optical properties would propagate into radar measurable. Large discrepancies in the derivation of the equivalent water content and snowfall rate from radar measurements could be observed when large-size parameters are accounted for.},

The comparison between the computed force (or hydrodynamic coefficients) and the literature correlations shows clearly that certain precautions must be taken. The mean deviation of the most accurate correlation considered in the present study from our full DNS results can be of the order of 20\% for the drag coefficient. For the lift and pitching torque coefficients, the deviations can increase up to roughly 25\%. This comparison shows that further works are definitively necessary to develop a complete set of correlations for ellipsoidal particles outside Stokes regime.},

Explicit expressions for these coefficients have yet to be determined. This review will examine sources of error in the HK relation that have led to the coefficients' scatter. Through an examination of theoretical, experimental, and molecular dynamics simulation studies of evaporation, this review will show that the HK relation is incomplete, since it is missing an important physical concept: the coupling between the vapor and liquid phases during evaporation. The review also examines a modified HK relation, obtained from the quantum-mechanically based statistical rate theory (SRT) expression for the evaporation flux and applying a limit to it in which the thermal energy is dominant. Explicit expressions for the evaporation and condensation coefficients are defined in this limit, with the surprising result that the coefficients are not bounded by unity. An examination is made with 127 reported evaporation experiments of water and of ethanol, leading to a new physical interpretation of the coefficients. The review concludes by showing how seemingly small simplifications, such as assuming thermal equilibrium across the liquid\textendash vapor interface during evaporation, can lead to the erroneous predictions from the HK relation that have been reported in the literature.},

Surface snow, where air-snow interactions take place, is viewed as slowly changing quasi-isothermal snow, implied by the observation of mainly rounded snow crystals. The role of snow for photochemistry is therefore expected to be purely geometric. However, large temperature gradients are often observed in these layers, which would imply high recrystallization and faceting. In controlled laboratory experiments we showed that temperature gradients on the order of 100 K m-1 do not lead necessarily to faceting if their sign changes with a daily cycle. The shape of snow crystals does not reflect necessarily the metamorphic process. With time-lapse X-ray tomography, recrystallization rates as high as 60\% of the total ice mass were observed during 12 hours. The high recrystallization rates in apparently isothermal snow not only contradict the current understanding of snow metamorphism, they also might influence chemical air-snow interactions.},

  abstract = {The present paper deals with diffusion in a porous solid, which is considered as a discrete random medium composed of random structural elements (pores) chaotically connected with each other. Each structural element is characterized by the passage time distribution function calculated with taking into account the correlations of flows passing through the neighboring pores. The analysis of a nonstationary diffusion process, after transition to the limit of times much exceeding the mean passage time of a single pore, enables to obtain general expressions connecting the effective diffusivity in a porous medium with the statistical parameters of structural elements. At the same time the values are calculated which characterize the deviation of the concentration distribution in a porous medium from the gaussian one obtained as a solution of the quasi-homogeneous diffusion equation. To make the general expressions more concrete it is necessary to introduce a model of structural elements (pores) which determines the passage time distribution. The models of straight and corrugated pores considered yield expressions for the effective diffusion coefficient in the Fick and Knudsen regions. A similar analysis of the nonstationary diffusion accompanied by the first order reaction allows to get the expression for the effective rate constant of the catalytic reaction in a porous medium.},

  abstract = {There are few measurements of the vapor growth of small ice crystals at temperatures below 2308C. Presented here are mass-growth measurements of heterogeneously and homogeneously frozen ice particles grown within an electrodynamic levitation diffusion chamber at temperatures between 2448 and 2308C and supersaturations si between 3\% and 29\%. These growth data are analyzed with two methods devised to estimate the deposition coefficient a without the direct use of si. Measurements of si are typically uncertain, which has called past estimates of a into question. We find that the deposition coefficient ranges from 0.002 to unity and is scattered with temperature, as shown in prior measurements. The data collectively also show a relationship between a and si, with a rising (falling) with increasing si for homogeneously (heterogeneously) frozen ice. Analysis of the normalized mass growth rates reveals that heterogeneously frozen crystals grow near the maximum rate at low si, but show increasingly inhibited (low a) growth at high si. Additionally, 7 of the 17 homogeneously frozen crystals cannot be modeled with faceted growth theory or constant a. These cases require the growth mode to transition from efficient to inefficient in time, leading to a large decline in a. Such transitions may be, in part, responsible for the inconsistency in prior measurements of a.},

  abstract = {Saltation of snow, the transport of snow in periodic contact with and directly above the snow surface, is governed by the atmospheric shear forces applied to the erodible snow surface, the nonerodible surface, and the moving snow particles. Empirical data measured over a snow-covered plain suggest functions for parameters important to the apportionment of atmospheric shear forces; the aerodynamic roughness height during saltation, the mean horizontal velocity of saltating particles, and the efficiency of the saltation process. The resulting mass transport expression shows an approximately linear increase in snow saltation transport rate with friction velocity, in agreement with the measurements presented. The expression is sensitive to the cohesion of the snow surface, as indexed by the threshold wind speed, that wind speed at which transport ceases; for wind speeds well above the threshold condition, higher threshold wind speeds correspond to higher transport rates. An adaptation of the expression allows calculation of the mass concentration of saltating snow from measured data and the transport rate of saltating snow from the mean wind speed at 10 m height. Application of the transport rate expression using measured wind speeds, directions, and weather observations demonstrates that the directional component of annual saltating snow transport does not always correspond with wind direction frequency.},

Tyndall figures are water-melting patterns that occur when ice absorbs light and becomes superheated. Here, we report a previously undescribed ice and water pattern formation process induced by near-infrared irradiation that heats one phase more than the other in a two-phase system. The pattern formed during the irradiation of ice crystals tens of micrometers thick in solution near equilibrium. Dynamic holes and a microchannel labyrinth then formed in specific regions and were characterized by a typical distance between melted points. We concluded that the differential absorption of water and ice was the driving force for the pattern formation. Heating ice by laser absorption might be useful in applications such as the cryopreservation of biological samples.
High-power illumination of thin ice crystals drives the formation of dynamic holes and water microchannel labyrinths.

Biotic samples consisting of algae (Chlamydomonas nivalis) and ice worms (a species of oligochaetes) were also collected and imaged. In the field, the snow and biological samples were mounted on copper plates, cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored in dry shipping containers which maintain a temperature of-196\textdegree C. The firn and glacier ice samples were obtained by extracting horizontal ice cores, 8 mm in diameter, at different levels from larger standard glaciological (vertical) ice cores 7.5 cm in diameter. These samples were cooled in liquid nitrogen and placed in cryotubes, were stored in the same dry shipping container, and sent to the SEM facility. In the laboratory, the samples were sputter coated with platinum and imaged by a low-temperature SEM. To image the firn and glacier ice samples, the cores were fractured in liquid nitrogen, attached to a specimen holder, and then imaged. While light microscope images of snow and ice are difficult to interpret because of internal reflection and refraction, the SEM images provide a clear and unique view of the surface of the samples because they are generated from electrons emitted or reflected only from the surface of the sample. In addition, the SEM has a great depth of field with a wide range of magnifying capabilities. The resulting images clearly show the individual grains of the seasonal snowpack and the bonding between the snow grains. Images of firn show individual ice crystals, the bonding between the crystals, and connected air spaces. Images of glacier ice show a crystal structure on a scale of 1-2 mm which is considerably smaller than the expected crystal size. Microscopic air bubbles, less than 15 firn in diameter, clearly marked the boundaries between these crystal-like features. The life forms associated with the glacier were easily imaged and studied. The lowtemperature SEM sample collecting and handling methods proved to be operable in the field; the SEM analysis is applicable to glaciological studies and reveals details unattainable by conventional light microscopic methods.},

The n.m.r. measurements are related to the solvation water which is associated with each binary salt. This solvation water is bound to the salt in a pseudo-crystalline structure, with the amount of water determined by the eutectic concentration of the salt. The results are given in tabular form and differ somewhat from previously published tables. Two controversial hydrated salts were added to the table, based on the n.m.r. data.

Les mesures sont utilis\'ees \`a calculer les relations entre phases dans la glace de mer en fonction de la temp\'erature, Un mod\`ele d'eau de mer bas\'e sur un m\'elange de sept sels binaires est employ\'e pour ces calculs. Les mesures de R.M.N. sont en relation avec l'eau de dissolution qui est associ\'ee \`a chaque sel binaire. Cette eau de dissolution est li\'ee au sel dans une structure pseudo-cristalline, la quantit\'e d'eau \'etant d\'etermin\'ee par la concentration eutectique du sel. Les r\'esultats sont donn\'es sous forme de tableau el sont un peu diff\'erents des tables publi\'ees auparavant. Sur la base des donn\'ees R.M.N., deux sels hydrates controvers\'es ont \'et\'e rajout\'es \`a la table.

Zusammenfassung
Quantitative Messungen der flussigen Uasserphase in einer Meereisprobe wurden mil einem kernmagnetischen Resonanzspektrometer vorgenommen. Die Messungen werden dazu benutzt. die Phasenbeziehungen im Meereis als Funktion der Temperatur zu berechnen. Ein Modell f\"ur Meerwasser auf der Grundlage eines Gemenges vor sieben Zweistoff-Salzen wird f\"ur diese Berechnungen benutet. Die kernmagnelisrhen Resonanzmessungen sind abh\"angig von dem L\"osungswasser, das in jedem der Zweistoff-Salzen vorkommt. Dieses L\"osungswasser ist in Form einer Pseudokristall-Struktur an die Salze gebunden, wobei seine Menge durch die eutektische Konzentration des Salzes bestimmt ist. Die Ergebnisse sind in tabellarischer Form dargestellt; sie unter-schieden sich etwas von fr\"uher herausgegebenen Tabellen. Zwei zweifelhafte hydratische Salze wurden aufgrund der kernmagnetischen Resonanzmessungen in die Tabelle mit aufgenommen.},

  abstract = {Snow is an agglomerate of ice crystals. The details of its mechanical behavior are still controversially discussed: what is the relative importance of intragranular-viscoplastic deformation versus grain boundary sliding under mechanical loading? In order to understand how snow deforms at the grain scale, micro-mechanical compression tests on dry snow have been performed using X-ray diffraction contrast tomography (DCT). DCT is a non-destructive, 3D characterization technique which combines the principles of X-ray absorption and diffraction imaging. DCT reveals simultaneously the grain structure (in terms of 3D shape and crystallographic orientation) and the absorption microstructure of polycrystalline materials that fulfill specific requirements. Coupled with a sample environment that maintains the snow sample at sub-zero temperature and allows the application of a constant load, this technique allows us to follow at the grain scale the microstructural changes undergone by the sample. We briefly describe the principle of the DCT technique and then present and discuss the first results obtained during in situ compression experiments performed on large-grained snow samples.},

Using direct numerical stability analysis of the coupled nonlinear particle-flow problem we compute the linear stability of the log-rolling orbit at small shear Reynolds number, \$\{\textbackslash rm Re\}\_a\$. As \$\{\textbackslash rm Re\}\_a \textbackslash to 0\$ and as the box size of the system tends to infinity we find good agreement between the numerical results and earlier analytical predictions valid to linear order in \$\{\textbackslash rm Re\}\_a\$ for the case of an unbounded shear. The numerical stability analysis indicates that there are substantial finite-size corrections to the analytical results obtained for the unbounded system. We also compare the analytical results to results of lattice-Boltzmann simulations to analyse the stability of the tumbling orbit at shear Reynolds numbers of order unity. Theory for an unbounded system at infinitesimal shear Reynolds number predicts a bifurcation of the tumbling orbit at aspect ratio \$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash rm c\} \textbackslash approx 0.137\$ below which tumbling is stable (as well as log rolling). The simulation results show a bifurcation line in the \$\textbackslash lambda\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm Re\}\_a\$ plane that reaches \$\textbackslash lambda \textbackslash approx0.1275\$ at the smallest shear Reynolds number (\$\{\textbackslash rm Re\}\_a=1\$) at which we could simulate with the lattice-Boltzmann code, in qualitative agreement with the analytical results.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the dispersion of a dynamically neutral material quantity in a fluid flowing throuh a porous medium. The medium is regarded as an assemblage of randomly orientated straight pores, and it is assumed that the path of a marked element of the material quantity consists of a sequence of statistically independent steps whose direction and duration vary in some random manner. The probability density function for the displacement of a single marked element is calculated and values for the dispersion of a cloud of marked elements then follow.The case is examined in which the flow satisfies Darcy's law (i.e. the mean velocity is linearly proportional to the mean pressure gradient), and the molecular diffusivity is sufficiently small for the dispersion to be primarily due to the randomness of the streamlines, but it is not assumed that effects of molecular diffusion can be altogether neglected. It is shown that the longitudinal dispersion in the direction of the mean flow may be described asymptotically by an effective diffusivity which is a function of U, l, a, K and T. (U denotes the average velocity, l the pore length, a the pore radius which is shown to be related to the permeability, k the molecular diffusivity, and T the time from the initial instant.) Expressions for the longitudinal diffusivity kl are obtained according to the relative values of l/U, T, t0 = l2/2k and t1 = a2/8k. These are given in \textsection 4, equations (4.3), (4.4) and (4.5). Speaking roughly, when t0 [Gt ] T [Gt ] l/U,kl/Ul is alogarithmic function of UT/l and increases with T; when T [Gt ] t0 [Gt ] l/U, which must eventually be the case however small k,kl/Ul is alogarithmic function of Ul/k and independent of T. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data reported in the literature and approximate agreement is obtained when E is put equal to the average diameter of the particles composing the porous medium.The lateral dispersion in the direction perpendicular to that of the mean velocity is found to be governed asymptotically by an effective diffusivity kt=316Ulk\_t = \textbackslash frac \{3\}\{16\} Ul. However, it is pointed out that some of the assumptions, namely that successive steps are statistically independent and that the dispersion of a cloud follows immediately from the statistical properties of the displacement of a single marked element, may not be valid for the lateral dispersion and this result is therefore suspect.Remarks are made in \textsection 5 on the dispersion for high values of the Reynolds number Ul/v (v = kinematic viscosity) when Darcy's law is not obeyed, and it is argued that kl/Ul should decrease as Ul/v increases.},

We show that the configuration probability is proportional to the inverse of the flow rate. Using a twodimensional network, advancing the interfaces using time integration, the computational time scales as the linear system size to the fourth power, whereas the Monte Carlo computational time scales as the linear size to the second power. We discuss the strengths and the weaknesses of the algorithm.},

The tests were strain-rate controlled, with strain rates ranging between 7.4610\^7 s\^1 and 6.6610\^5 s\^1. The analysis of the test results revealed that the relationship between yield stress and viscous strain rate is best given by a power law, similar to polycrystalline ice. However, the power-law exponent n is a function of density and varies between 1.8 (low-density snow, \guillemotright{} 5 200 kg m\^3) and 3.6 (high-density snow, \guillemotright{} 4320 kg m\^3). The tests also showed that lower-density snow displays a significant non-linear stress\^strain response before yielding. Two further aspects of the constitutive behaviour of snow were identified: (1) the strainrate independence of the post-yield work-hardening behaviour in compression and (2) the independence of the axial yield stress in relation to the confining pressure. The experimental observations are discussed with respect to the mechanical properties of polycrystalline ice, which is the constituent material of the load-bearing ice skeleton.},

To this end, we have analyzed the metamorphism and concurrent densification of new snow under isothermal conditions by means of X-ray microtomography and compiled a comprehensive data set of 45 time series. In contrast to previous measurements on isothermal metamorphism on time scales of weeks to months, we analyzed the initial 24\textendash 48 h of snow evolution at a high temporal resolution of 3 hours. The data set comprised natural and laboratory-grown snow, and experimental conditions included systematic variations of overburden stress, temperature and crystal habit to address the main influences on specific surface area (SSA) decrease rate and densification rate in a snowpack. For all conditions, we found a linear relation between density and SSA, indicating that metamorphism has an immediate influence for the densification of new snow. The slope of the linear relation, however, depends on the other parameters which were analyzed individually to derive a best-fit parameterization for the SSA decrease rate and densification rate. In the investigated parameter range, we found that the initial value of the SSA constituted the main morphological influence on the SSA decrease rate. In turn, the SSA decrease rate constituted the main influence on the densification rate.},

  abstract = {The complex interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer and the heterogeneous land surface is typically not resolved in numerical models approximating the turbulent heat exchange processes. In this study, we consider the effect of the land surface heterogeneity on the spatial variability of near-surface air temperature fields and on snow melt processes. For this purpose we calculated turbulent sensible heat fluxes and daily snow depth depletion rates with the physics-based surface process model Alpine3D. To account for the effect of a heterogeneous land surface (such as patchy snow covers) on the local energy balance over snow, Alpine3D is driven by two-dimensional atmospheric fields of air temperature and wind velocity, generated with the non-hydrostatic atmospheric model ARPS. The atmospheric model is initialized with a set of snow distributions (snow cover fraction and number of snow patches) and atmospheric conditions (wind velocities) for an idealized flat test site. Numerical results show that the feedback of the heterogeneity of the land surface (snow, no snow) on the near-surface variability of the atmospheric fields result in a significant increase in the mean air temperature {$\increment$}TA= 1.8 K (3.7 K, 4.9 K) as the snow cover fraction is decreased from a continuous snow cover to 55 \% (25 \%, 5 \%). Surface turbulent sensible heat fluxes and daily snow depth depletion rates are strongly correlated to mean air temperatures, leading to 22-40 \% larger daily snow depth depletion rates for patchy snow covers. Mean air temperatures over snow heavily increase with increasing initial wind velocities and weakly increase with an increasing number of snow patches. Numerical results from the idealized test site are compared with a test site in complex terrain. As slope-induced atmospheric processes (such as the development of katabatic flows) modify turbulent sensible heat fluxes, the variation of the surface energy balance is larger in complex terrain than for an idealized flat test site.},

  abstract = {The macroscopic description of the hysteretic behavior of two-phase flow in porous media remains a challenge. It is not obvious how to represent the underlying pore-scale processes at the Darcy-scale in a consistent way. Darcy-scale thermodynamic models do not completely eliminate hysteresis and our findings indicate that the shape of displacement fronts is an additional source of hysteresis that has not been considered before. This is a shortcoming because effective process behavior such as trapping efficiency of CO2 or oil production during water flooding are directly linked to pore-scale displacement mechanisms with very different front shape such as capillary fingering, flat frontal displacement, or cluster growth. Here we introduce fluid topology, expressed by the Euler characteristic of the nonwetting phase ({$\chi$}n), as a shape measure of displacement fronts. Using two high-quality data sets obtained by fast X-ray tomography, we show that {$\chi$}n is hysteretic between drainage and imbibition and characteristic for the underlying displacement pattern. In a more physical sense, the Euler characteristic can be interpreted as a parameter describing local fluid connectedness. It may provide the closing link between a topological characterization and macroscopic formulations of two-phase immiscible displacement in porous rock. Since fast X-ray tomography is currently becoming a mature technique, we expect a significant growth in high-quality data sets of real time fluid displacement processes in the future. The novel measures of fluid topology presented here have the potential to become standard metrics needed to fully explore them.},

  abstract = {The maximum entropy production rate (MEPR) in the solid\textendash liquid zone is developed and tested as a possible postulate for predicting the stable morphology for the special case of steady state directional solidification (DS). The principle of MEPR states that, if there are sufficient degrees of freedom within a system, it will adopt a stable state at which the entropy generation (production) rate is maximized. Where feasible, the system will also try and adopt a steady state. The MEPR postulate determines the most probable state and therefore allows pathway selections to occur in an open thermodynamic system. In the context of steady state solidification, pathway selections are reflected in the corresponding morphological selections made by the system in the solid\textendash liquid (mushy) zone in order to cope with the required entropy production. Steady state solidification is feasible at both close to, and far from equilibrium conditions. Based on MEPR, a model is proposed for examining the stability of various morphologies that have been experimentally observed during steady state directional solidification. This model employs a control volume approach for entropy balance, including the entropy generation term (S gen), which depends on the diffuse zone and average temperature of the solid\textendash liquid region within the control volume. In this manner, the model takes a different approach from the successful kinetic models that have been able to predict key features of stable morphological patterns. Unstable planar interfaces, faceted cellular arrays, cell\textendash dendrite transitions, half cells both faceted and smooth, and other transitions such as the absolute stability transition at high solid/liquid velocities are examined with the model. Uncommon solidification morphological features such as non-crystallographic dendrites and discontinuous cell-tip splitting are also examined with the model. The preferred morphological change-direction for the emergence of the stable morphological feature is inferred with the MEPR postulate in a manner analogous to the free energy minimization principle(s) when used for predicting phase stability and metastable phase formation. Aspects of mixed-mode order transformation characteristics are also discussed for non-equilibrium solidification containing a diffuse interface, in contrast to classifying solidification as purely a first order transformation. The MEPR model predictions are shown to follow the experimental transitions observed to date in several historical studies.},

For small values of k = {$\gamma$}g{$\delta$}, where g is the gradient strength, {$\delta$} is the duration of the gradient pulse, and {$\gamma$} the gyromagnetic ratio, the PFGSE amplitude gives the diffusion coefficient D(t). The exact short-time diffusion coefficient, D(t)Do=1-(4DotS/(9Vp{$\pi$})-DotHS/(12Vp)+ptS/6Vp, provides an important method for determining the surface to pore-volume ratio SVp. Here the mean surface curvature H = {$\langle$}1R1 + 1R2{$\rangle$}. Combining early D(t) with the magnetization decay one obtains the surface relaxivity {$\varrho$}. The long-time effective diffusion constant derived from PFGSE gives information on the tortuosity of the connected space. The diffusion coefficient measured by PFGSE equals that derived from electrical conductivity only when {$\varrho$} = 0. Exact solutions with partially absorbing boundary conditions for a periodic structure are used to illustrate the influence of {$\varrho$} on the diffusion coefficient. M(k,t) can be well represented by a convolution of the structure factor of the connected pore space with an appropriate Gaussian propagator. This ansatz provides a model-independent way of obtaining the structure factor.},

Microstructural variables, including the directional arrangement of bonds, impact thermo-mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, and conductivity of the granular material. The conductivity model proposed here incorporates a fabric tensor, linking the textural arrangement of a granular assembly to a material property. In this work, dry dense snow was subject to temperature gradients (100 and 50K/m) in a lab. The resulting morphology was driven by temperature gradient metamorphism. Underpinning the importance of microstructure, the observed heat transfer coefficient (EHC) increased in the direction of the applied gradient without appreciable changes in density. Periodic tomography yielded measurable microstructural data used to calculate a fabric tensor and the evolving conductivity tensor. Through the fabric tensor the analytical conduction model accounts for \textasciitilde 43\% of the observed increase in EHC. The model also calculates a decrease in conductivity in the plane orthogonal to the temperature gradient due to a developing anisotropy. Snow metamorphism models parameterized by density alone cannot predict such directionally-dependent behavior because they are strictly valid for only isotropic materials.},

  abstract = {Porous materials, which are characterized by the large surface area and percolated nature crucial for transport, play an important role in many technological applications including battery, ion exchange, catalysis, microelectronics, medical diagnosis, and oil recovery. Phase separation of a mixture in such a porous structure should be strongly influenced by both surface wetting and strong geometrical confinement effects. Despite its fundamental and technological importance, however, this problem has remained elusive for a long time because of the difficulty associated with the complex geometry of pore structures. We overcome this by developing a novel phase-field model of two coupled order parameters, the composition field of a binary mixture and the density field of a porous structure. We find that demixing behavior in complex pore structures is severely affected by the topological characteristics of porous materials, contrary to the conventional belief that it can be inferred from the behavior in a simple cylindrical pore. Our finding not only reveals the physical mechanism of demixing in random porous structures but also has an impact on technological applications.},

In the case of air bubbles agreement is only fair for approximately spherical bubbles trapped during freezing and is somewhat better for drilled cylindrical holes open to the atmosphere. The lack of agreement and the considerable scatter in the data are probably due to uncontrolled variations in pressure and shape and to the slow accumulation of frost. In the case of discoidal vapor figures the agreement is much poorer and the scatter is much greater, probably because of large uncontrolled variations in shape, air content, and temperature of the figures. Calculation of the effect of small size, for which viscous flow of the vapor is important, shows it to be negligible for the figures used in the experiments. For spherical brine pockets at temperatures a few degrees or more below freezing agreement is fairly good, considering the uncertainties in the diffusion coefficient, but at the ice point the predicted speed is about 5 times that observed, probably because the brine concentration in the pockets at this temperature was not in fact zero as required by the theory.},

For example, it remains unclear whether drifting snow is necessary for wind-packing or not. A better understanding of wind-packing could improve snow-cover models and avalanche danger forecasts and contribute to the assessment of mass balances in polar regions. We designed a closed-circuit, obround wind tunnel to study the process of wind crust formation. A SnowMicroPen was used to measure how the hardness of the snow evolved. The results show that no crust forms without saltation. Drifting snow is a necessary but not sufficient condition for wind-packing. The dynamics of erosion and deposition appear to be equally important.},

At constant density, the development of branch grains decreases the strength, thermal conductivity, and crystal number density while increasing the mean crystal size. A theory is developed that uses the following major assumptions: (1) at growth sites the thermal gradient is a function of crystal separation and (2) vapor flux is a function of local thermal gradient. A computer model based on the theory is compared with stereological measurements of snow from a carefully controlled experiment. The model calculates grain size distributions within the accuracy of the measurements. The major conclusion is that the theory explains the main process in temperature gradient metamorphism. The inclusion of surface energy considerations and stereological refinements would probably improve the theory when techniques for stereological analysis become more accurate.},

Specifically, the single component multiphase LBM can simulate the interfacial phenomena of surface tension and adsorption and thus be used for modeling fluids such as water and its vapor in porous media. This paper provides an introduction to LBM applications to interface configurations in partially saturated porous media. Key elements of this LBM application are fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions that successfully mimic the Young-Laplace equation and liquid film adsorption. LBM simulations of liquid behavior in simple pore geometry considering capillarity and adsorption are in good agreement with analytical solutions and serve as critical first steps toward validating this approach. We demonstrate the usefulness of LBM in constructing virtual liquid retention measurements based on porous media imagery. Results of this study provide a basis for application of LBM to understanding liquid configurations in more complex geometries and clear a path for applications involving interface migration, flow, and transport in partially saturated porous media.},

Theory predicts that during coarsening the average size-scale of a two-phase mixture increases with time as t1/3 when the two-phase mixture is self-similar, or time independent when scaled by a time-dependent length. Here, we explain why this temporal power law is so robustly observed even when the microstructure is not self-similar. We show that there exists an upper limit to the length scales in the system that are kinetically active during coarsening, which we term the self-similar length scale. Length scales smaller than the self-similar length scale evolve, leading to the classical temporal power law for the coarsening dynamics of the system. Longer length scales are largely inactive, leading to a non-self-similar structure. This result holds for any two-phase mixture with a large distribution of morphological length scales.},

The governing equations for both the fluid and the solid particle have been solved using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian based finite-element method. Under Stokes flow conditions, an ellipsoid without inertia is observed to follow a perfectly periodic orbit in which the particle rotates and moves from side to side in the tube as it settles. The amplitude and the period of this oscillatory motion depend on the initial orientation and the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid. An ellipsoid with inertia is found to follow initially a similar oscillatory motion with increasing amplitude. Its orientation tends towards a flatter configuration, and the rate of change of its orientation is found to be a function of the particle Stokes number which characterizes the particle inertia. The ellipsoid eventually collides with the tube wall, and settles into a different periodic orbit. For cases with non-zero Reynolds numbers, an ellipsoid is seen to attain a steady-state configuration wherein it falls vertically. The location and configuration of this steady equilibrium varies with the Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {To obtain the full description of the dynamical and microphysical finescale structures required for the computation of the radar-derived brightband parameters, a numerical model has been developed. A bulk microphysics module was introduced into a nonhydrostatic, fully compressible dynamic framework. A microphysical parameterization scheme, with five water categories (vapor, cloud water, snow, melting snow, and rain), describes the interactions related to the evolution of the melting layer (melting and diffusional exchanges of mass of each hydrometeor category). Dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical processes are fully coupled. The main characteristics of the bulk parameterization scheme for melting of snow are the following: 1) wet snow is described by its water content and by an additional prognostic variable, namely, the diameter of the smallest snowflake not yet completely melted; 2) the fall velocity of the melting snowflakes is based on the laboratory observations; and 3) a size-dependent ventilation coefficient of the melting particles is used. With this new formulation of the melting process some approximate analytical relations between variables that characterize the melting layer are obtained. The results of simulations show that the nonuniformity of the snow content causes horizontal variability of various atmospheric properties within the melting layer, which leads to the generation of convective cells. The impact of the induced finescale dynamics on the microphysical structure within the melting zone is analyzed.},

A number of drag coefficient expressions were employed for the calculation of aerodynamic diameter. A set of model objects having surface fractal dimensions varying from 2.00 to 2.55 was constructed, from which all the parameters required to compute shape and surface roughness factors can be obtained. Drag coefficients (CD) formulated by Ro and Neethling, Haider and Levenspiel, Thompson and Clark, Ganser, and Tran-Cong et al. were shown to perform similarly within the specified criteria. The aerodynamic diameters calculated follow the expected trend of decreasing diameter with increasing surface roughness. Comparisons with literature data show that the CD expressions by Ro and Neethling, Haider and Levenspiel, and Ganser, on average, agree to within 17\textendash 23\% of the measured values.},

The drawback to these models used to be the inability to obtain quantitative macroscopic parameters representing larger (experimental-scale) media. However, recently developed modeling techniques, combined with more widely available computational resources, make the simulation of macroscopic parameters from a network approach viable. A network model for the slow flow of an incompressible fluid in disordered packed beds is presented. Fundamental fluid mechanics equations are solved at the pore scale and then translated to macroscopic behaviour using a network approach. The results reproduce experimental permeabilities and show excellent quantitative fits to residence time distributions for mechanical dispersion in real beds. Simulations of the RTD are of special interest, because they are definitive links between pore-scale flow behavior and macroscopic responses.},

While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions.

The model is based on the governing equations describing two-phase flow in porous media, and can handle both drainage, imbibition, and steady-state displacement. Dynamic wetting layers in corners of the pore space are incorporated, with focus on modeling resistivity measurements on saturated rocks at different capillary numbers. The flow simulations are performed on a realistic network of a sandpack which is perfectly water-wet. Our numerical results show saturation profiles for imbibition in agreement with experiments. For free spontaneous imbibition we find that the imbibition rate follows the Washburn relation, i.e., the water saturation increases proportionally to the square root of time. We also reproduce rate effects in the resistivity index for drainage and imbibition.},

For all crystallographic orientations, it was found that Schmid's (critical resolved shear stress) law was obeyed by the peak stress. Slip lines clearly showed that basal slip was the deformation mode.},

All physical variables are allowed to be singular along the interface with the exception of the magnetic field and electric field. The set of conservation laws for the interface are derived and the explicit form of the entropy production is obtained. Taking into account spacial and time reversal symmetries, we establish the phenomenological relations between the fluxes and thermodynamic forces. We conclude by providing an example where constraints for the values of the transport coefficients are obtained as a consequence of conditions which must be fulfilled to guarantee that the matrix of transport coefficients remains positive definite.},

  abstract = {The role of the viscosity ratio {$\kappa$} during forced imbibition in porous media is investigated theoretically using a new simulator, and experimentally based on displacements in model pore networks. Both theory and experiment show that {$\kappa$} is an important parameter of microdisplacement in porous media, not only for intermediate and large capillary number values, but also for small values, say Ca {$<$} 10-6. In the latter region the residual nonwetting saturation Sor is virtually independent of Ca for {$\kappa$} {$<$} 1, and increases weakly with decreasing Ca for {$\kappa$} {$>$} 1. The unexpected result is that, even for very small values of Ca, Sor decreases appreciably as {$\kappa$} decreases, especially in the case of very good wettability. Simulations indicate that the effect of {$\kappa$} on Sor for low Ca values is enhanced as the contact angle decreases. The phenomenon is attributed to a synergistic effect between capillary microfingering and localized viscous forces. It must be emphasized that the velocity gradients which are created locally by the advance of a single meniscus, or of a wetting film, are sufficiently large to make viscous stresses important, even when the Ca value of the macroscopic flow is very low (say, of order 10-8). A favorable viscosity ratio reduces the extent of capillary microfingering and thus increases the efficiency of microdisplacement, despite the fact that for Ca {$<$} {$\sim$}10-6 the viscous stresses are negligible on a macroscopic scale. Further work is needed to analyze the synergism between {$\kappa$} and \texttheta e at low Ca values.},

Pore geometry and connectivity were characterized before and after each experimental challenge using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and two-dimensional MR relaxation correlations.

In contrast, a carbonate core sample showed evidence of significant dissolution leading to a six-fold increase in effective permeability. MR images and relaxation measurements revealed a marked increase in the volume and connectivity of pre-existing pore networks in the carbonate core. We infer that the increase in permeability in the carbonate core was enhanced by focused dissolution in the existing pore and fracture networks that enhanced fast-flow paths through the core.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) was successfully applied for non-invasive online monitoring of biofilm development, sloughing, and forced detachment. Biofilm cultivation was performed in a tube reactor directly placed in the MRM scanner. Based on the differences in relaxation time of free and bound protons, the distributed water signal was allocated to the bulk and the biofilm phase. The velocity of the flowing water in the tube reactor was measured in all three directions (x, y, and z) at spatial resolutions of 78 \textmu m. From the velocity data, maps of flow gradients (shear rates) were derived. The experiments showed that a more compact biofilm structure is sloughed off in total with nearly no biomass left on the substratum. Continued biofilm cultivation resulted in filamentous biofilm structures, which did not show any sloughing. Experiments at higher Reynolds numbers were performed in order to force biofilm detachment. Continuous measuring of proton velocity and biomass was used to characterize the different stages of biofilm development. The measurements revealed that biofilms are able to resist extremely high local shear stress being raised up to factor of 20 compared to the mean local shear stress acting on the complete biofilm surface. The maximum local shear stress of single biofilm structures exposed to flow was found to be on average seven times higher compared to the mean local shear stress of the entire biofilm surface. MRM was able to visualize and quantify the development of biofilms and interaction of biofilms with the surrounding fluid at the meso-scale. It is suggested that detachment and sloughing depends on both internal and external structural parameters. Biotechnol.

The width, spacing, and areal coverage of the fingering flow path and occurrence of capillary barriers have been demonstrated using dye tracer experiments that were conducted at the field and in cold laboratories. However, the initial shape and temporal development of fingering and lateral flows are unclear because a vertical or horizontal section of snow is needed to observe them. To examine this, we carried out non-destructive observations of fingering flow development and capillary barriers in layered snow in a cold laboratory using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) via 3-dimensional rapid imaging method. {$\mu$}CT was also used to associate the water flow phenomena with the snow microstructure. The snow column was directly sampled in the vertical direction using the infiltration column from a natural snow-pack without breaking the layered structure of the snow. The experimental results showed that fingering flows developed in all of the snow samples. Fingering flow path increased and lateral flow developed through the continuing water supply. The small discontinuity of pore size and snow density in the vertical direction acted as capillary barriers and induced a lateral flow. These results showed that the persistence of a fingering flow path and an increase in the number of flow paths are important phenomena in understanding the infiltration of water into dry snow, which are needed develop snowpack models that include water moving processes. Detailed information on the heterogeneity of pore distribution and snow microstructures in layered snowpack are needed to understand the water flow phenomena in a natural snowpack.},

  abstract = {In this study, we compared the performance of a three dimensional (3-D) watertransport model and the physics-based multi-layer SNOWPACK model with a dual-domain approach for preferential flow, to simulate water infiltration by preferential flow. We used data from three experiments to validate our models: liquid-water profiles and preferential-flow patterns around capillary barriers, measured in cold laboratories (Avanzi et al., 2016); water-sprinkle experiments measuring discharge amounts in the field (Ishii et al., 2014); and infiltration experiments in nature-identical snow with simultaneous measurements of wet-snow metamorphism, measured using micro-computed tomography, (Avanzi et al., 2017). Qualitatively, the dual-domain approach of SNOWPACK produced similar patterns of water infiltration to the 3-D model. However, percolation speed in preferential channels, the position of the water-ponding layer, and the simulated time when the transition from preferential to matrix flow occurred differed between the two models. We show that the 3-D model yields good agreement with laboratory experiments and field observations. Our results also suggest that the 3-D model could be used to enhance the accuracy of the SNOWPACK model's simulation by refining the parameters of the dual-domain approach. Such improvements enhance the ability of SNOWPACK to simulate liquid-water infiltration in snow, thereby enhancing its ability to predict the formation of wet-snow avalanches.},

Weakly hydrogen-bonded surface molecules diffuse over the surface in a rolling motion, their number and mobility increasing with increasing temperature.

The process is ubiquitous and responsible for a wide range of consequences in materials with biological, geophysical, and technological significance. Because such systems are often exposed to spatial or temporal variations in thermodynamic forcing, there are a host of fluid mechanical phenomena that result from this underlying melting behavior. The fluid dynamics of unfrozen surfaces holds clues for understanding the bulk behavior of polycrystalline materials, from Earth's mantle to the stratosphere and beyond. In this review we focus on the fluid dynamical consequences of the premelting of solids.},

Ice particles can occur during landing and take-off of aircraft at ground level up to the lower bound of the stratosphere at cruising altitude. It may be expected that the particle Reynolds number is high because the flow around the aircraft is in certain regions characterized by strong acceleration and deceleration of the flow. In combination with this flow pattern, the rotation of particles becomes important. Applicable translational and rotational equations of motion combined with a drag correlation taking into account rotation will be derived for a Lagrangian type particle tracking. Orientation is described with quaternions to prevent the singularities associated with the description by Euler angles. The influence of regular shaped particles on collection efficiencies is investigated. Test cases are the flow past a cylinder, a NACA0012 airfoil and a NHLP L1/T2 three element airfoil. Due to the increased computational effort compared to the purely translational approach, observed trajectory simulation times are reported.},

  abstract = {The snow microstructure is crucial for the mechanical behavior of snow, but is usually simplified in numerical models. In Discrete Element Models (DEM), often used in snow mechanics, the microstructure is typically represented by sphere assemblies. This renders a model validation difficult, as the real snow crystal shapes affect the actual contacts and consequently the macromechanical behavior. To approach this problem from the experimental side, we created simplified microstructures comprising spherical ice particles and examined this model snow under structural and mechanical aspects. We developed a new method to create uniform ice spheres and performed a detailed particle characterization using 3D computed tomography (CT). We examined sintered sphere assemblies to relate microstructural and macromechanical properties in a geometrically well-defined system. Microstructural variation was created by varying the sample density and sintering time, to study the role of the number and size of contacts. 3D CT scans were taken of sintered sphere samples, which were then tested in unconfined compression experiments together with a nature identical snow type as a reference. The scans were evaluated regarding the number of particles and contacts, and were used to compute the elastic modulus, as additional mechanical property. The results of the particle characterization showed the spherical shape and sharp size-distribution of the particles, which are the main prerequisites for model validation. The CT image analysis showed the reproducibility of the sphere assemblies and can be applied for efficient reconstruction of the experimental samples as initial condition for simulations. The mechanical properties conform with the reference snow and the expectations from literature, however, the CT scans revealed a complex geometry of the sintered contacts with measurable impact on the mechanical properties.},

For this purpose, the particle porosity is modelled using agglomerates of small particles of spherical or cubical shape, respectively. This provides variation of the specific surface area while porosity is kept constant. The simulation results show a significant influence of porosity and Reynolds number on drag coefficient and Nusselt number.

  abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) events have caused severe floods in mountainous areas in the recent past. Because of the complex interactions of physical processes, it is still difficult to accurately predict the effect of snow cover on runoff formation for an upcoming ROS event. In this study, a detailed physics-based energy balance snow cover model (SNOWPACK) was used to assess snow cover processes during more than 1000 historical ROS events at 116 locations in the Swiss Alps. The simulations of the mass and energy balance, liquid water flow, and the temporal evolution of structural properties of the snowpack were used to analyze runoff formation characteristics during ROS events. Initial liquid water content and snow depth at the onset of rainfall were found to influence the temporal dynamics, intensities, and cumulative amount of runoff. The meteorological forcing is modulated by processes within the snowpack, leading to an attenuation of runoff intensities for intense and short rain events and an amplifying effect for longer rain events. The timing of runoff generation relative to the rainfall seems to be strongly dependent on initial liquid water content, snow depth, and rainfall intensities. As these snowpack and meteorological conditions usually exhibit a strong seasonality, cumulative runoff generation during ROS also varies seasonally. ROS events with intensified snowpack runoff were found to be most common during late snowmelt season, with several such events also occurring in late autumn. These results demonstrate the strong influence of initial snowpack properties on runoff formation during ROS events in the Swiss Alps.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a laboratory observation of spin attitudes and angular velocities of saltating sand particles in wind-blown sand flux by using the high-speed and dynamic cinecamera and presents a numerical simulation to show the effect of spin on the saltating trajectories of sand particles. Experiment results show that a saltating sand particle has two basic spin attitudes, rolling spin ({$\Omega$}x, which is perpendicularity to wind direction and parallel with sand surface) and left/right spin. The percentages of the former and the latter attitude are 5\% and 95\%, respectively. The left/right spin angular velocities range from 0 revolutions per second (``rev/s'' henceforth) to 800 rev/s and obey a single-peaked distribution, the peak value of which lies in (150 rev/s, 250 rev/s). The rolling spin angular velocity of a saltation sand particle is variational along its entire saltating trajectory. The left/right spin vector is composed of two spin components, {$\Omega$}y (called lateral spin component, rotating around the wind direction) and {$\Omega$}z (called up spin component, rotating around the axis perpendicular to the sand bed). The theoretical simulation indicates that lateral and up spin components not only have effects on the trajectories' scales (i.e., heights and lengths) but also have effects on the trajectories' dimensions, especially when they are higher than 2000 rev/s and 200 rev/s, respectively. While the rolling spin angular velocities only change the trajectories' heights and lengths, especially for the rolling angular velocity higher than 300 rev/s.},

In this paper, we propose a stochastic model of the dynamics of rigid bodies immersed in viscous flows to solve this problem. We first modulate the dynamic equations of rigid bodies using generalized Kirchhoff equations (GKE). Then, a stochastic differential equation called the Langevin equation is proposed to represent the velocity increments due to the turbulences. After the precomputation of the Kirchhoff tensor and the kinetic energy of a synthetic turbulence induced by the object moving, we utilize a fractional-step method to solve the GKE with vortical loads of drag and lift dynamics in runtime. The resulting animations include both inertial and viscous effects from the surrounding flows for arbitrary geometric objects. Our model is coherent and effective to simulate immersed rigid-body dynamics in real-time.},

The main experimental techniques for pore space characterisation, including direct imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry and gas adsorption, are firstly summarised. A review of the main pore network construction techniques is then presented. Particular focus is given on how such constructions are adapted to the data from experimentally characterised pore systems. Current applications of pore network models are considered, with special emphasis on the effects of adsorption, dissolution and precipitation, as well as biomass growth, on transport coefficients. Pore network models are found to be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting meso-scale phenomena, linking single pore processes, where other techniques are more accurate, and the homogenised continuum porous media, used by engineering community.},

  abstract = {Pore network models have been applied widely for simulating a variety of different physical and chemical processes, including phase exchange, non-Newtonian displacement, non-Darcy flow, reactive transport and thermodynamically consistent oil layers. The realism of such modelling, i.e. the credibility of their predictions, depends to a large extent on the quality of the correspondence between the pore space of a given medium and the pore network constructed as its representation. The main experimental techniques for pore space characterisation, including direct imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry and gas adsorption, are firstly summarised. A review of the main pore network construction techniques is then presented. Particular focus is given on how such constructions are adapted to the data from experimentally characterised pore systems. Current applications of pore network models are considered, with special emphasis on the effects of adsorption, dissolution and precipitation, as well as biomass growth, on transport coefficients. Pore network models are found to be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting meso-scale phenomena, linking single pore processes, where other techniques are more accurate, and the homogenised continuum porous media, used by engineering community.},

The tortuosity is introduced to characterize the highly irregular and convoluted property of capillary pathways for fluid flow through a porous medium.

  abstract = {The snow-cover model SNOWPACK was applied to the wet-snow areas of Japan. Simulated variations of snow type, snow depth and weight, profiles of snow density, temperature and liquid-water content were compared with snow-pit measurements. The snow-depth simulation during early winter agreed with the measurements, but the differences between the simulation and the measurements increased during the course of the melt season. These differences were caused by underestimation of the energy balance at the snow surface, mainly that regarding sensible-heat flux during the melt season. The underestimation was caused by the implicit numerical treatment of the heat-transport equation. Consistent with the underestimation of snowmelt, simulated metamorphosis of compacted particles into melt forms was slower than the change shown by the measurements, and faceted snow particles, which constitute a snow type not actually found in the study area, sometimes appeared in the model. The inaccurate melt treatment also influenced simulated densities, which were larger than the measurements at small densities, while they were smaller than the measurements at large densities. Greater accuracy was achieved when an empirical compressive viscosity formulation for wet snows inJapan was introduced. A new version of SNOWPACK, with an accurate treatment of melt processes, is available.},

In this study, we measured the WRC of several snow samples, which had different characteristics (grain size, bulk dry density and grain type), using a gravity drainage column experiment and then analysed these data using the Van Genuchten soil physics model (VG model). The shape of the WRC depended strongly on both the sample grain size, d, and bulk dry density,  . Therefore, we introduced the parameter  /d to model the WRC of snow.

Conversely, neither of these parameters of the VG model for rounded grains showed obvious dependence on  /d. These results suggest that water movement through snow cover can be modelled using grain size, bulk dry density and grain type based on the soil physics model.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In countries like Japan, particular solid precipitation particles (PPs), such as unrimed PPs and graupel, often form a weak layer in snow, which triggers slab avalanches. An understanding of weak PP layers is therefore essential for avalanche prevention authorities to design a predictive model for slab avalanches triggered by those layers. Specific surface area (SSA) is a parameter that could characterize the physical properties of PPs. The SSAs of solid PPs in Nagaoka \textendash{} a city in Japan experiencing the heaviest snowfall in the country \textendash{} were measured for four winters (from 2013/2014 to 2016/2017). More than 100 SSAs of PP were measured during the study period using the gas absorption method. The measured SSA values range from 42 to 153\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{2}\&thinsp;kg\textsuperscript{-1}. Under melting conditions, PPs showed comparatively smaller values. Unrimed and slightly rimed PPs exhibited low SSA, whereas heavily rimed PPs and graupel exhibited high SSA. The degree of PP riming depends on the synoptic meteorological conditions. Based on the potential of weak PP layer formation with respect to the degree of riming of PPs, the results indicate that SSA is a useful parameter for describing the characteristics of PP, and consequently predicting avalanches triggered by weak PP layers. The study found that the values of SSA strongly depend on wind speed (WS) and wet-bulb temperature (\emph{T}\textsubscript{w}) on the ground. SSA increases with increase in WS and decreases with increase in \emph{T}\textsubscript{w}. An equation to empirically estimate the SSA of fresh PPs in Nagaoka using WS and \emph{T}\textsubscript{w} was established. The equation successfully reproduced the fluctuation of SSA. The SSA equation, along with the meteorological data, is an efficient first step toward describing the development of weak PP layers in the snow cover models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Thus, to model water movement through the snow cover, a formulation for the WRC as a function of snow characteristics must be established. In order to examine the dependence of the WRC on the grain size of snow, we measured the WRCs of snow (550 kg m-3) of various grain sizes in gravity drainage column experiments. Our experiments revealed many similarities between the WRCs of snow and sand. Thus, we applied two soil physics models, the Brooks and Corey model (BC model) and the van Genuchten model (VG model), which are standard models in soil physics to analyze the WRC of snow. Two parameters in both models that affected the shape of the WRC had a strong relationship with sample grain size. The parameter related to the value of the reverse of air entry suction increased with an increase in grain size, whereas the parameter related to the gradient of \texttheta v versus h (d\texttheta v / dh) decreased with an increase in grain size. From these results, we obtained linear equations between those two parameters and grain size. Our results suggest that the WRC of snow can be described as a function of grain size using soil physics models.},

Correlations are proposed for the drag force, the lift force, the pitching torque, and the torque caused by the rotation of the particle. Each of the correlations depends on Re number, the dimensionless rotation and the angle of incidence between the particle and the direction of the local fluid velocity. The fit parameters in the correlations for each of the particle shapes are determined by performing a large number of ``true'' DNS simulations of four different types of particles. The true DNS simulations are carried out with an improved mirroring immersed boundary method. The resulting correlations for the forces and the torques are suitable to be used in Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian simulations, where an accurate prediction of the forces and torques is required to determine the motion of the particles.},

Here, we perform an objective comparison of a variety of state-of-the-art pore-scale models, including lattice Boltzmann, stochastic rotation dynamics, volume-of-fluid, level-set, phase-field, and pore-network models. As the basis for this comparison, we use a dataset from recent microfluidic experiments with precisely controlled pore geometry and wettability conditions, which offers an unprecedented benchmarking opportunity. We compare the results of the 14 participating teams both qualitatively and quantitatively using several standard metrics, such as fractal dimension, finger width, and displacement efficiency. We find that no single method excels across all conditions and that thin films and corner flow present substantial modeling and computational challenges.},

These data were then used to create a finite-element mesh for the fracture void space, and the Navier-Stokes equations were solved within this domain. Flow experiments were also conducted within the same fracture casts, over a range of flowrates. The simulations confirm the existence of a weak inertia regime for Reynolds numbers in the range of 1-10, in which the non-Darcy pressure drop varies with the cube of the flowrate. Although of theoretical interest, this effect is, however, probably too small to be of engineering interest. At Reynolds numbers above about 20, both the simulations and experiments exhibit a Forchheimer-type regime, in which the non-Darcy pressure drop is quadratic in the flowrate.},
