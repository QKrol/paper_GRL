\section{Introduction}

Porous media flow is important for a wide range of applications in nature and technology, spanning from groundwater remediation and oil recovery to packed bed reactors and particle filters. In these flows, the highly complex and three-dimensional pore geometries give rise to complicated pore velocity fields that form the backbone for transport, mixing and chemical reaction processes. Detailed knowledge of these velocity fields is important for the modelling of effective parameters, most notably the permeability and the prediction of transport in porous media \cite{bear_dynamics_1972,scheidegger_physics_1974}. Despite its importance and extensive research, however, the relation between geometrical features of porous media and the resulting flow is still not fully understood.


Given that detailed knowledge of geometrical features of porous media is often unavailable, the classical flow modeling approach has been to represent the porous medium as a lattice of circular tubes that represent the pore network \cite{scheidegger_physics_1974}. The flow in the tubes is assumed uniform and the velocity profile parabolic. While this is a rather crude approximation of the real geometry and flow behaviors, it has provided useful predictions for flow and transport. Early studies have modelled velocity distributions \cite{haring_statistical_1970}, permeability \cite{fatt_network_1956,katz_quantitative_1986} and particle dispersion \cite{saffman_theory_1959} based on bulk statistics of the medium geometry such as pore size distributions. These early studies have spurred many subsequent works on statistical pore scale models e.g. \citeA{dullien_single_1975,kutsovsky_nmr_1996,maier_simulation_1999,de_anna_prediction_2017} and \citeA{dentz_mechanisms_2018}. The second class of models that hinges on the simplified lattice representation of porous media are the so-called pore network models \cite{thompson_modeling_1997}. For both classes of models, the simplified modelling of local hydraulic resistance of individual pores based on Hagen-Poiseuille is a central element.


Many authors tried to relate the statistics of pore velocity to statistics of pore geometry represented by e.g. the local pore radius \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the connectivity between pores\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{etc}\DIFdelend . For example, one of the simplest models is the so-called \emph{capillary bundle} model, in which the porous medium is conceptualized as a parallel arrangement of capillaries with given pore sizes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{scheidegger_physics_1974}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{scheidegger_physics_1974}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Extensions of this model include parallel arrangements of wavy tubes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{le_borgne_effective_2011}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{le_borgne_effective_2011}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . These simple models are not appropriate for complex porous media, for which the network aspect is important. That is, in general, the connectivity between pores cannot be neglected and the concept of the linear pore breaks down \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{dentz_mechanisms_2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{dentz_mechanisms_2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . An ad-hoc model that conceptualizes flow in porous media as a system of serial and parallel pore arrangements can be found in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend statistically related velocity distributions to pore size distributions of statistically generated 3D porous media. Based on direct numerical simulations in 2D porous media composed of disks, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{de_anna_prediction_2017} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{de_anna_prediction_2017} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend showed that the low velocity tail of the pore velocity distribution is governed by local pore size. This is a notable result as it suggests that the slow flow velocities are not strongly dependent on the connectivity between pores. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{alim_local_2017} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{alim_local_2017} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend showed that pore velocity distributions are governed by local correlations of pore sizes that organize flux ratios at pore junctions, while pore size itself was a poor predictor of flux ratios. They simplified two-dimensional porous medium flow by a network of tubes with varying diameter and the flow within each tube was calculated by solving for Kirchoff’s circuit law for two-dimensional Poiseuille flow within the tubes of rectangular cross section. Even though using tubes with varying diameter is a refinement compared to simpler models with tubes of constant diameter, the simplification with respect to real geometries is still strong. Despite this, a comparison of simulation results with the experimentally obtained velocity distribution in a two-dimensional micromodel composed of pillars showed reasonable agreement \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{alim_local_2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{alim_local_2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . As mentioned, the statistical models in these works are based on the concept that local velocity profiles are parabolic. Some recent papers provided qualitative examples comparing pore velocity profiles to a parabola that suggest the assumption may be reasonable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{de_anna_prediction_2017,dentz_mechanisms_2018} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{de_anna_prediction_2017,dentz_mechanisms_2018} }%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend and some evidence is provided by the comparison between simulations and experiments by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{alim_local_2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{alim_local_2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . However, a rigorous assessment of local hydraulic resistance in three-dimensional pore geometries is still missing in the literature. 


With the advent of experimental techniques like micro-computed tomography there is now access to impressive details of three dimensional porous media architectures. Even though today\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend s computing facilities make it possible to solve flow and transport with unprecedented accuracy in these complex geometries using direct numerical simulations, this approach is only feasible in small domains. Simple models that reduce the full complexity of real porous media are still needed. A lattice representation is the standard approach in so-called pore network models in which a Kirchhoff-type system of equations is solved to model single or multiphase porous medium flows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{thompson_modeling_1997}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{thompson_modeling_1997} }%DIFAUXCMD
especially in absence of a detailed microstructure}\DIFaddend . The lattice is usually constructed based on data from experimental pore scale characterization measurements, e.g. imaging or mercury intrusion porosimetry. These pore network models are a valuable tool for understanding meso-scale phenomena, linking single pore processes and continuum porous media used in engineering \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citeA{xiong_review_2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{xiong_review_2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Besides a sound network construction approach that mimics the real media, another critical aspect for the accuracy of modeling is the representation of local hydraulic resistance in the pores. 


In this paper we start with a theoretical background where we define local pores based on consecutive iso-pressure surfaces, followed by a new model for the local hydraulic conductivity. In the methods section we describe our numerical experiment consisting of direct numerical simulations (DNS) from which we obtain local velocity and pressure data in heterogeneous porous media. Based on a post-processing of the DNS data we can extract the local hydraulic conductivity of a local pore. In the results we compare the measured hydraulic resistances to the Hagen-Poiseuille model and to the newly formulated model based a local shape parameter circularity. In the discussion we treat the limitations and extrapolations of the newly proposed model. In the conclusion we state the model performance compared to the HP model.



\section{Theoretical Background}

For low Reynolds numbers and incompressible flow, the local flow in a porous media is described by the Stokes equations,
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\nabla} p =  \mu\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u}\,,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\,}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~~~}\DIFaddend \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{u}=0\label{eq:stokes_local}
	\end{equation}
with pressure $p$ and velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and dynamic viscosity $\mu$. For an arbitrary volume \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$V$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal{V}$ }\DIFaddend in a porous media, enclosed by surface \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\partial V$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\partial \mathcal{V}$ }\DIFaddend given by two iso-pressure surfaces \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$S_{p_1}$ and $S_{p_2}$ and a remaining a porous media domain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal{S}_{p_1}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{p_2}$ and solid-liquid surface boundary }\DIFaddend $\Gamma$, we can write down the integral form of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Navier-Stokes equations }%DIFDELCMD < {}

}\DIFaddend 

\begin{equation}
\int\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_V }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{\mathcal{V}} }\DIFaddend \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla} p-\mu \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u}\right) dV 
= \int\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_{\partial V}  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{\partial \mathcal{V}}  }\DIFaddend p\,\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dS+}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dS-}\DIFaddend \mu \int\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_{\partial V} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{\partial \mathcal{V}} }\DIFaddend \mathbf{u}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\cdot }\DIFaddend (\mathbf{\nabla}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\otimes }\DIFaddend \mathbf{u})\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\cdot}\DIFdelend \mathbf{n}\,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dS-}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dS+}\DIFaddend \mu \int\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_{V} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{\mathcal{V}} }\DIFaddend (\mathbf{\nabla}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\otimes}\DIFaddend \mathbf{u})^2 dV=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0, }\DIFaddend \label{eq:stokes_dissipation}

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with $\mathbf{n}$ the normal vector pointing outwards of surface $\partial V$, and $\otimes$ the dyadic product. }\DIFaddend Given that at the porous media boundary domain $\Gamma$ we have a no-slip condition $\mathbf{u}=0$ we can write 
\begin{equation}
	Q \Delta p = -\mu\int_{S_{p_1}+S_{p_2}} \mathbf{u}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\cdot }\DIFaddend (\mathbf{\nabla}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\otimes }\DIFaddend \mathbf{u})\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\cdot}\DIFdelend \mathbf{n}\,dS +\mu \int\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_V }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{\mathcal{V}} }\DIFaddend (\mathbf{\nabla}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\otimes }\DIFaddend \mathbf{u})^2 dV, \label{eq:pressuredrop}
\end{equation}
with the total flux \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{through any cross section }\DIFaddend defined by 

\begin{equation}
	Q=\int \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\, dS.
\end{equation}

Here we introduce the notion of disconnected iso-pressure surface $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$ for a given pressure value $p$. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note that this consideration works for any fluid tube bounded by iso-pressure surfaces and iso-pressure surface of velocity magnitude at which velocity is (approximately) zero. Considering completely saturated conditions the boundary terms }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Iso-pressure surfaces are usually disconnected because they exist in the fluid domain only and are thus interrupted by the solid phase of the media. The first term }\DIFaddend of Eq.~(\ref{eq:stokes_dissipation})\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will drop when multiple poresare added (meaning $\mathbf{n}\rightarrow -\mathbf{n}$)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the boundary term, will be less significant when the total volume $V$ is enlarged by increasing $\delta p$. Furthermore, when we have saturated conditions, the complete pore space can be compartmentalized in a network of enclosed volumes $V_i(p_i, p_i+\delta p_i )$, which we will later call pores. For all the pore spaces in the network the boundary term only exist virtually, since the same boundary term is subtracted for the pores to which they are physically connected}\DIFaddend . Therefore Eq.~(\ref{eq:stokes_dissipation}) intrinsically only evaluates
\begin{equation}
Q \Delta p=\mu\int (\nabla \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\otimes }\DIFaddend \mathbf{u})^2 dV.\label{eq:pore_based_energy_dissipation}
\end{equation}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the following we }\DIFaddend apply a decomposition of the velocity vector  $\mathbf{u} = u_p \mathbf{\hat{p}} + u_r \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ with $\mathbf{\hat{p}} =\mathbf{ \nabla}p/|\mathbf{ \nabla}p|$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. For Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) flow $\mathbf{u}$ is parallel to the pressure gradient, for which in simple geometries exact solutions can be derived. In the following we will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(longitudinal direction in respect to the flow) and $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ perpendicular to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (transversal direction in respect to the flow). We }\DIFaddend assume that the most important contributions to the viscous dissipation tensor $\nabla_i u_j$ is given by $\nabla_i u_p$ i.e. $\mathbf{\nabla}_i u_r \ll \mathbf{\nabla}_i u_p $. This assumption has been verified in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SI }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supplementary information (SI) }\DIFaddend for the porous media that we have used below \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This assumption }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend leads to 

\begin{equation}
\left|\nabla_i u_j\right|^2 \approx  \left|\nabla_r u_p\right|^2 + \left|\nabla_p u_p\right|^2 .\label{eq:reduced_dissipation_tensor}
\end{equation}

Here the first term is expected to be more important for gradually varying pore geometries since gradients in the velocity in the longitudinal direction are usually much lower than in transverse direction. Equations (\ref{eq:stokes_local})-(\ref{eq:reduced_dissipation_tensor}) are valid for arbitrary volumes $V$. When we consider viscous dissipation of an \textit{infinitesimal} enclosed volume $dV$ defined by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\mathcal{S}_i,\mathcal{S}_{i+1}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal{S}(p),\mathcal{S}(p+\delta p)$ }\DIFaddend and their respective areas \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$A_i, A_{i+1}$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$A(p), A(p+\delta p)$}\DIFaddend , separated by average distance $dx$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{defined by $dV = A(p)dx$, }\DIFaddend we can estimate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(analogous to \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The circularity parameter is related to the compactness factor $C = \mathcal{C}/4\pi$ in \cite{mortensen_reexamination_2005}. The coefficients \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ }\DIFaddend can be calculated (in first order of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compactness}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{circularity}\DIFaddend ) analytically and numerically for simple shapes of the iso-pressure surfaces, such as squares, triangles, or a perturbation of a sphere by spherical harmonics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend For the second, longitudinal term, we can assume that the total flux $Q$ remains constant for $p\rightarrow p+dp$, and the change of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{velocity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the velocity in longitudinal direction }\DIFaddend is caused by a change in cross-sectional area \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$A_i$, or in other words, the channelization of the pore

with unknown $\alpha_2$.

To generate heterogeneous porous media \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend that will form the basis for the direct numerical simulations, we have used Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) to generate 3 porous media \cite{teubner_level_1991,hyman_heterogeneities_2012,siena_relationship_2014}. A threshold of the field function of the GRF is used to define the porous media-fluid interface $\Gamma$ with porosities $0.68, 0.34$ and $0.17$ respectively. In the SI we have listed a few geometrical parameters such as average pore size \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and surface roughness. These porous media are used as input for direct numerical simulations (\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{DNS, }\DIFaddend OpenFOAM v. 4.1, \citeA{weller_tensorial_1998}), that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solves }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solve }\DIFaddend the steady state Navier-Stokes equations in the pore space. The boundary conditions are defined at the inlet $p_1$ and outlet $p_2$ and a no-slip \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{condition }\DIFaddend for the porous media-fluid interface. A visualization of the three porous media is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DNS}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Next, }\DIFaddend a chain of visualization toolkit (VTK) based image analysis techniques \cite{schroeder_visualization_2006,hernderson_paraview_2007} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend employed to extract iso-pressure surfaces $\mathcal{S}(p)$ and enumerate the disconnected areas identifying as an iso-pressure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{slice }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{patch }\DIFaddend $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

\begin{equation}
	\DIFadd{f_d\left(\mathbf{x},\mathcal{S}\right) = \min \{\Vert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\Vert \} ~|~ \mathbf{y}\in \mathcal{S}.
}\end{equation}
\DIFadd{for each $i,k$ we define the averaged distance matrix 
}\begin{equation}
	\DIFadd{d_{i,k} = \frac{1}{A_i(p)}\int_{\mathcal{S}_i(p)} f_d(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathcal{S}_k(p+\delta p)) \,dS_i.

\DIFadd{The closest neighbor $\mathcal{S}_j(p+\delta p)$ is found by the minimum value of $d_{i,j} = \rm{min}\left\{ d_{i,k}\right\}$.

We use forward integration of consecutive patches until merging or splitting takes place. The distances between averaged locations $\mathbf{x}_i(p)$ and $\mathbf{x}_j(p+\delta p)$ of two consecutive pores are sensitive to topology changes. A constraint on these distances and flux conservation }\DIFaddend is used to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{define the end and the beginning of a pore. A visualization of such a topology change, or splitting and merging of pores }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{end forward integration. The precise values for these constraints can be found in the SI. A demonstration of the correct identification of pores by forward integration }\DIFaddend is shown in Fig.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:isop_surfaces} (Right)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, showing a merging of two pores}\DIFaddend . 

The main challenge with the data format of the OpenFoam simulations is that it is unstructured, and the meshing is refined towards the boundary of the porous media $\Gamma$. Although this ensures that the geometry is accurately described and that the simulation convergences, it also causes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{problems by extracting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{challenges in the extraction of }\DIFaddend $\mathcal{S}(p)$ by using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend VTK contour filter. Since it is based on a threshold on $p$ it breaks up the mesh close to $\Gamma$ into many disconnected \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{small }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{noisy }\DIFaddend area patches. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To remove these small patches a threshold of a relatively low value for $\left|u\right|< \epsilon$ is chosen. This results in much smoother, but slightly smaller iso-pressure surfaces. The loss of area can be estimated and corrected for each pore individually by $A(p)\rightarrow A(p) + \left.\mathcal{L}\epsilon/\overline{\nabla u}\right|_{\partial \mathcal{S}}$. If this correction is omitted it will result in a significant proportion of values measured pressure gradients below the HP-model, which is physically impossible. Evidently this deviation was mostly observed for relatively small pores. The estimate for $\mathcal{C}$ is subsequently also underestimated if $\epsilon$ is chosen too high. It is however difficult to get a reliable estimate for $\mathcal{C}$ when $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ because $\partial \mathcal{S}(p)$ becomes irregular. Therefore, we have chosen to estimate $\mathcal{C}$  at finite $\epsilon$, there where it is most robust. $\epsilon$ was chosen to be $2\times10^{-5}$ for the first two porous media and $2\times10^{-6}$ for the last. These values where chosen by visual inspection, not to loose to much detail of the shape of $\mathcal{S}$ and to get rid of most of the noise at the edges. Small area patches that remain are filtered out based on their size. The distance $dx_{\rm{max}}$ is chosen such that upon visual inspection, clearly connected surfaces remain connected, such as can be seen in Fig.\ref{fig:isop_surfaces}(left). A more specific description of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These are removed by applying a filter on the area size of the patches, resulting in a reduction of total surface area of maximal $1\%$.

We observe however that these contours are locally irregular and therefore will very likely lead to an overestimation of $\mathcal{C}$, which will influence the fitting value of $\alpha_1$}\DIFaddend . 

For each of the three porous media we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can plot the local pressure gradient versus the PH model, i.e. Eq.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{evaluate Eq.~}\DIFaddend (\ref{eq:infi_dp}) for all consecutive iso-pressure pairs $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and $\mathcal{S}_j(p+\delta p)$}\DIFdelend . To obtain measured values for the resistance of a pore, we divide the total pressure difference $\Delta p$ by the total \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fluxe }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{flux }\DIFaddend $Q$. We fit Eq.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend (\ref{eq:R_model}), to all pores belonging to one porous media, yielding three sets of $\alpha_i$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s}\DIFdelend .

In Fig.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:DNS}, bottom, the results of the infinitesimal pressure gradients versus the HP model (Eq.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend (\ref{eq:HP})) are shown. We observe that the HP model underestimates the pressure gradient up to two orders of magnitude for the first porous media, to a relative good estimate for the third.

For each porous media Eq.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend (\ref{eq:infi_dp}) has been fitted by minimizing the least-squared \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{error }\DIFaddend independently to obtain estimates for $\alpha_i$. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{values for $\alpha_0 =[0.26,0.40,0.98]$, $\alpha_1 = [0.72,0.69,0.32]$, and $\alpha_2 = [4.7\times 10^{-3},1.3 \times 10^{-3},0.22]$. The relative }\DIFdelend contribution of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first and second term of $f(\alpha_i)$ are given by $[14\%,29\%,69\%]$, $[86\%,71\%,30\%]$ for $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$.

The relative contributions of the HP-model, i.e. ($\alpha_0$ to $\alpha_1\mathcal{C}$)is increasing with decreasing porosity. When the porosity is doubled the relative contribution of $\alpha_0$ is roughly divided by two. For the third porous media we observe that the relative contribution of circularity is the smallest.

This is most pronounced when the pores have a complex geometry, which are usually correlated with large pore areas, see Fig.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:local_and_integrated}. An average underestimation of the resistances leads to an average overestimation of the mean fluxes in a network model. This will affect transport predictions e.g. breakthrough times will be underestimated \cite{dentz_mechanisms_2018}. Network models such as \cite{alim_local_2017}, often base their local resistances on the smallest distances to the porous media boundary. In general this will underestimate the cross-sections and therefore obtain higher resistances for the HP-based model, also reducing the error with respect to our HP model. Since anomalous diffusion has been correlated with the degree of heterogeneity of the porous media, it is important that low flux regions are included. The inaccurate representation of the low velocity regions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend larger cross-sectional areas will therefore contribute to poor estimates of anomalous long residence times. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This will lead to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Estimating these residence times properly is important because they underly }\DIFaddend non-Fickian scaling \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{behaviour }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{behavior }\DIFaddend of the dispersion of flow tracers \cite{dentz_mechanisms_2018,dentz_delay_2006}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The range of local resistances in Fig.\ref{fig:local_and_integrated}(bottom) show that low resistances are correlated with high values for $\mathcal{C}$, and are poorly estimated by HP. These pores are crucial for predicting preferential flow paths since they depend on the paths of least resistances throughout a network. For this purpose we have computed the RMSRE weighted by the mean flux. We found a reduction from $67\%, 30\%, 6\%$ to $2\%, 2\%,5\%$ for three heterogeneous respectively, which shows a remarkable improvement of high flux pores.

\DIFdelend One of the key observations of our work is the possibility of introducing a local geometric factor that provides for the ratio of pressure difference and mass flux in a given \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{channel}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pore}\DIFaddend . The factor depends on the considered \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{channel }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pore }\DIFaddend and not the rest of the complicated shape of the medium boundary. The non-triviality of this observation is made transparent by employing the boundary integral representation which is equivalent to the Stokes equations obeyed by the flow. The representation gives the flow as an integral over the medium surface where the points of the surface appear as sources that produce the flow as superposition. The ``charge" of such sources is proportional to the stress tensor at the boundary and the flow that each charge induces in space is given by an appropriate Green's function, see e.g. \cite{pozrikidis_boundary_1992}. Our result demonstrates that contributions other than those from the boundary of the considered \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{channel }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pore }\DIFaddend can be neglected in the superposition. The mechanism by which this occurs, consists of both screening effect and destructive interference between different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{channels}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pores}\DIFaddend . This deserves further studies which are beyond our scope here. We have used circularity, as a single measure for the shape of $\mathcal{S}(p)_i$, but to improve on this result it might be necessary to include other shape parameters such as curvatures measures of $\mathcal{S}(p)_i$, which may lead to non-linear behavior in a circuit model. 

Although the proposed definition of individual pores deals naturally with junctions, a straight forward pore-network implementation is still missing. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is partly due to the exclusion of iso-pressure patches that are singular, and have no neighboring patches due to rapid changing topologies. The ratios of excluded surface area patches are given by $18 \%, 26 \%$ and $2\%$, which, at least for the first two porous media, prevents a continuous integration of the network-topology. One possible solution is to decrease $\delta p$ and consequentially also increasing the resolution of the DNS. An alternative option is to use a statistical network representation based on our results. }\DIFaddend Given that the distributions of the resistances show similarity with a log-normal distribution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, a statistical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(see SI), a }\DIFaddend pathway for a statistical network based on these distributions seem feasible. 

\section{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Conclusions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Conclusion}\DIFaddend }
We have proposed a new iso-pressure surface based definition for individual pores in heterogeneous porous media with the aim of measuring and modeling the local hydraulic resistance which can potentially be used in a pore-network model. This new definition uses the constant flux as constraint on the length of the pore. The definition of the pores allows us to estimate the local hydraulic resistance in terms of the viscous dissipation tensor. This can be modeled by the circularity of the iso-pressure surfaces which significantly improves the Hagen-Poiseuille model for high porosity heterogeneous media.
