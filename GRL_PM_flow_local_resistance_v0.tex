[ Resolving local velocities for laminar flow in porous media is essential to transport processes. Using direct numerical simulations to solve the Navier-Stokes equations is computationally costly for statistical representative volumes. Pore network models allow for much faster solutions and resolve much larger domains. However, the pore network architecture and constitutive model for the hydraulic resistance heavily influence the permeability and the quality of local velocity predictions. Here, we investigate the validity of a commonly used constitutive law. We start by generating three three-dimensional artificial geometries representing porous media. In this way we can control the geometrical parameters, such as the porosity and the averaged interface area. As a benchmark, we use high fidelity numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to resolve the pressure and velocity field for laminar flow in the pore-space of the artificial geometries. We propose a new definition for pores based on iso-pressure surfaces and topology changes that enables us to measure the local hydraulic resistance. We show that it can be over-estimated up to two orders of magnitude. We propose a new constitutive model that is based on the geometry of iso-pressure surfaces. This model shows that the sphericity of iso-pressure surfaces is key to predict the local hydraulic resistances of heterogeneous porous media more reliable. The distributions of local resistances and effective pore lengths show an interesting pathway to new statistical network representations of laminar flow in porous media.]

	\item reduction of information by pore network models, review Review of pore network modeling of porous media: Experimental characterizations, network constructions and applications to reactive transport
	\item definition of pores and channels are not unique. 
	For porous media with arbitrary geometry, there is no standard definition for individual pores that collectively build up the pore space in a porous media. A law for local the hydraulic resistance between two iso-pressure surfaces such as for the Hagen-Poiseuille case is still missing, since one cannot apply the symmetry argument to solve the Navier-Stokes equations exactly. To relate to the concept of a network of pores with certain hydraulic resistances a definition of a pore is indispensable. Most pore-network models represent pores by junctions without an internal pressure drop, and the connections between the junctions are represented by a channel, given a certain hydraulic resistance. 
	\item 
\end{itemize}

The goal of this study is to perform Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) that solve the Navier-Stokes equations in heterogeneous porous media. The boundary conditions are chosen such that Re number is chosen within the Stokes regime $Re\ll1$. These simulations enables us to know the locally the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and the local pressure field $p$. We propose a new definition of local pores for which we can measure the local pressure drop and the internal resistance of the porous media. 



\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Static Navier stokes equations in porous media}
We assume that for low Reynolds number, incompressible flow in a porous media, the local flow can be described by the Navier-Stokes equations. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stokes_local}
	\mathbf{\nabla} p = - \nu\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u}\,,\,\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{u}=0
	\end{equation}
with pressure $p$ and velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and kinemetic viscosity $\nu$. 
For a volume $V$ in a porous media, enclosed by surface $\partial V$ given by two isopressure surfaces $S_{p_1}$ and $S_{p_2}$ and a remaining a porous media domain $\Gamma$, we can write down the integral form of the Navier-Stokes equations


\begin{equation}\label{eq:stokes_dissipation}
\int_V \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla} p-\nu \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u}\right) dV 
= \int_{\partial V}  p\,\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dS+\eta \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{\nabla} \mathbf{u})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dS-\eta \int_{V} (\mathbf{\nabla}\, \mathbf{u})^2 dV=0
\end{equation}

Given that at the porous media boundary domain $\Gamma$ we have a no-slip condition $\mathbf{u}=0$ we can write \markred{check signs}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pressuredrop}
	Q \Delta p = -\eta\int_{S_{p_1}+S_{p_2}} \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{\nabla} \mathbf{u})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dS -\eta \int_V (\mathbf{\nabla}\, \mathbf{u})^2 dV,
\end{equation}


with the total flux defined by 

\begin{equation}
	Q=\int \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\, dS.
\end{equation}




\subsection{Pore identification}

\begin{centering}
\begin{figure}[t!]\label{fig:isop_surfaces}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/example_pore.png}~~~~
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/merging_pores.eps}
\caption{Left: A visualization of a collection of consecutive iso-pressure surfaces comprising one pore, including the average coordinates of the iso-pressure surfaces indicated by the spheres. The color code of the spheres is given by the distance between the average coordinates between two consecutive iso-pressure surfaces. Right: A visualization of a junction of three pores for which the total flux is conserved $\sum_{i=1}^3 Q_i = 0$. This visualization is based on a subset of the DNS results of porous media \#2}
\end{figure}
\end{centering}
Here we introduce the notion of disconnected iso-pressure surfaces $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$ for a given pressure value $p$.
It is useful to observe that this consideration works for any fluid tube bounded by iso-pressure surfaces and iso-pressure surface of velocity magnitude at which velocity is (approximately) zero. Considering completely saturated conditions the boundary terms of Eq.~\ref{eq:stokes_dissipation} will be drop when multiple pores are added (meaning $\mathbf{n}\rightarrow -\mathbf{n}$). Therefore Eq.~\ref{eq:stokes_dissipation} intrinsically will only evaluate

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pore_based_energy_dissipation}
Q \Delta p=\eta \int (\nabla \mathbf{u})^2 dV,
\end{equation}

When we consider a decomposition of the velocity vector  $\mathbf{u} = u_p \mathbf{\hat{p}} + u_r \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ with $\mathbf{\hat{p}} =\mathbf{ \nabla}p/|\mathbf{ \nabla}p|$. For HP flow $\mathbf{u}$ is parallel to the pressure gradient, for which in simple geometries exact solutions can be derived. In the following we will assume that the most important contributions to the dissipation tensor $\nabla_i u_j$ is given by the assumption that $\mathbf{\nabla}_i u_r \ll \mathbf{\nabla}_i u_p $. This assumption has been tested in the SI for the porous media that we have used below. This leads to 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reduced_dissipation_tensor}
\left|\nabla_i u_j\right|^2 \approx  \left|\nabla_r u_p\right|^2 + \left|\nabla_p u_p\right|^2 .
\end{equation}

Here the first term is much more important since the velocity-velocity correlation length in the longitudinal direction is usually much larger than the average pore size. When we consider the dissipation of an infinitesimal enclosed volume $dV$ defined by $\mathcal{S}_i,\mathcal{S}_{i+1}$ and their respective areas $A_i, A_{i+1}$, separated by average distance $dx$ we can estimate the first term of Eq.~\ref{eq:reduced_dissipation_tensor} analogous as done by \cite{mortensen_reexamination_2005} with
\begin{equation}
	\left|\nabla_r u_p\right|^2 = \left(\alpha_0+\alpha_1\,\gamma^{-2}\right)\frac{ Q^2}{A^3}~~~ \rm{with}~~~ ,
\end{equation}
with sphericity parameter $\gamma^{-1} = \mathcal{L}/\sqrt{ 4\pi A(p)}$ with perimeter $\mathcal{L} = \int_{\partial \mathcal{S}_i}dl$. The sphericity parameter is inversely related to the compactness factor $\gamma^{-2}\sim \mathcal{C} $in \cite{mortensen_reexamination_2005}. The coefficient $a$ and $b$ can be calculated for simple shapes of the iso-pressure surfaces, such as squares, triangles, or a perturbation of a sphere by spherical harmonics \citeA{mortensen_reexamination_2005}. For heterogeneous media the class of shapes are generally unknown. For the second, longitudinal term, we can assume that the total flux $Q$ remains constant for $p\rightarrow p+dp$, and the change of velocity is caused by a change in crossectional area $A_i$, or in other words, the channelization of the pore 
\begin{equation}
	\left|\nabla_p u_p\right|^2 = \alpha_2  \frac{Q^2}{A^4}\left|\frac{\partial A}{\partial x }\right|^2,
\end{equation}
with unknown $\alpha_2$. When we combine the two expressions we obtain, for infinitesimal pressure difference $d p$ and corresponding $dV = A dl_{\rm{eff}}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:infi_dp}
	dp = \frac{Q}{A^2} f\left(\alpha_i,\mathcal{S}(p)\right) dx= 8 \pi \nu\frac{Q}{A^2}\left(\alpha_0+\alpha_1\gamma^{-2} + \alpha_2 \frac{1}{A}\left|\frac{\partial A}{\partial x }\right|^2\right)\,dx
\end{equation}
For pipe-like geometries, it is expected that $f(\alpha_i)\sim 1$, and the infinitesimal pressure drop is given by Hagen-Poiseuille equation 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:HP}
		\frac{dp}{dx} = 8 \pi \nu\frac{Q}{A^2} 
\end{equation}

The total pressure gradient along a full pore is then given by 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\Delta p}{L_{\rm{eff}}} =  Q \frac{1}{L_{\rm{eff}}}\int^{L_{\rm{eff}}}_{0}\frac{1}{A^2}f\left(\alpha_i,\mathcal{S}(p)\right)\,dx
\end{equation}

with 
\begin{equation}
	L_{\rm{eff}} = \int^{L_{\rm{eff}}}_{0} dx
\end{equation}

from which we find a expression for a model for the total hydraulic resistance 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:R_model}
	\mathcal{R}_m = \int^{L_{\rm{eff}}}_{0}\frac{1}{A^2}f\left(\alpha_i,\mathcal{S}(p)\right)\,dx
\end{equation}

When the geometry of a media is given by a long pipe, the hydraulic resistance is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille law $R_m = R_{\rm{HP}}$, meaning that $f(\alpha_i)\rightarrow 1$ and will therefore only depend on the cross-section area  $A(p)$.



\section{Methods}

\caption{A visualization of the velocity field $|u|$ and pressure field $p$ in the pore space of the three porous media used in this study.}
\end{figure}


To generate heterogeneous porous media, that will form the basis for the direct numerical simulations, we have used Gaussian Random Fields to generate 3 porous media. A threshold is used to define the porous media-fluid interface $\Gamma$ and its porosity. In Table \ref{tab:results} we have collected the measures of these three porous media. The geometries are chosen such that we have a wide range in porosity $\phi$, relative pore size $l_p$ and surfaces roughness. The pore size is defined by $l_p = 4 \phi/s$ with $s= A_{\rm{tot}}/V$ the ratio of porous media interface $A_{\rm{tot}}$and the total volume $V$.The surface roughness is defined by the standard deviation of the mean curvature $H$ divided by the average pore size $l_p$. These measures are introduces to show the wide range of chosen geometries. These porous media are used as input for direct numerical simulations (OpenFOAM v. 4.1) \cite{weller_tensorial_1998} that solves the Navier-Stokes equations in the pore space. The boundary conditions are defined at the inlet $p_1$ and outlet $p_2$ and a no-slip for the porous media-fluid interface. A visualization of the three porous media is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DNS}. Then a chain of VTK-based image analysis techniques \citeA{schroeder_visualization_2006,hernderson_paraview_2007} are employed to extract iso-pressure surfaces $\mathcal{S}(p)$ and enumerate the disconnected areas identifying as an iso-pressure slice $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$, part of a pore and measure its surface area $A_i(p)$, sphericity $\gamma_i(p)$, average location $\mathbf{x}_i(p)$ and average flux $Q_i(p)$. For each $\mathcal{S}_i(p)$ its closest neighbor $\mathcal{S}_j(p+\delta p)$ is identified by its smallest distance $d_{i,j}= \left|  \mathbf{x}_i(p)-\mathbf{x}_j(p+\delta p)\right|$. By forward integration of the first iso-pressure patches $\mathcal{S}_i(p_0)$ we identify all patches belonging to the same pore $\mathcal{P}_l(\Delta p) = \{\mathcal{S}_k(p_i)\}$. Since the averaged coordinates of an iso-pressure surface is very sensitive to topological changes, a maximal distance between two consecutive coordinates can be used to define the end/beginning of a pore. A visualization of such a topology change, or splitting and merging of pores is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:isop_surfaces} (Right). For each $\delta p$ we can now evaluate Eq.~\ref{eq:infi_dp} and for each pore, we can evaluate Eq.~\ref{eq:R_model}. A visualization of an iso-pressure surface $\mathcal{S}(p)$ and its devision of patches is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:segmentation}.

\section{Discussions}

Discussion on sentivities of the method 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Relative contributions of sphericity and channelization. 
	\item Choosing $u_0$ to minimize point noise area patches of $S_i$, because of the mesh representation close to the interface.
	\item Choosing $dx_{max}$
	\item small pores, can also have a very complex shape, since there are more topology changes to be expected when $S_i$ is highly convoluted, as indicated by high $\gamma$. for Eq.~\ref{eq:infi_dp} needs at least 2 isopressure surface patches. 
	\item sphericity values higher than $\gamma >0$
	\item Measured resistances function $f(\alpha) < 1$, is physically impossible. Here we measure a small portion that violates this physics. this is possible due to the method of cutting the iso pressure surfaces with a value $u_{min}$ leading to smaller areas. We have tried to correct for it with a factor that is calculated by the difference between the maximum $v_{max}-v_{min}$ by a linear extension of the area.  , but it is difficult to do this for very small areas since the cutoff of the area by $v_min$ is quit a significant portion. 
	\item The removal of the all the noise produced from the very fine mesh at close to the porous media interface is practically impossible, therefore, the final data has another threshold in the post processing on very small areas.   
	\item We can relax the condition of the boundary of a pore from $|u| = 0$ to $|u| < \epsilon$, reducing the complexity of the geometry of iso-pressure surfaces. The image analysis techniques become therefore much more complex and involve an analysis bases on the Morse-Smale Complex from the Topology ToolKit \cite{tierny_topology_2018} which is an extension of the VTK image analysis techniques used above. We have implemented this for the first porous media and found that the scatter in figure \ref{fig:local_pressure_drop} is significantly reduced. However when we fit the data to $f(\alpha_i)$, we find a similar, slightly worse performance of the model. This finding is relevant in two ways. The fist is that the order of magnitude of the local hydraulic resistance is well captured by the sphericity parameter, and this is valid even when the iso-pressure surfaces become very large, e.g. much larger than the average pore size. The second way is that iso-pressure surfaces can be subdivided into smaller pores which makes it easier to develop a method that extracts iso-pressure surfaces based on the geometry without doing the expensive actual DNS.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Odd observations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $u_s$ is relatively high when iso-pressure surfaces have a hole, (genus < 0)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We have performed direct numerical simulations of laminar flow in three distinct heterogeneous porous media that vary in porosity and roughness.  
	\item We propose a new definition of individual pores in heterogeneous porous media with the aim of modeling the local hydraulic resistance that can be used in a pore-network model. The pores are defined a collection of disjoint iso-pressure surfaces that are topologically similar. If, by increasing or decreasing pressure, the topology of the iso-pressure surface changes the beginning and the end of the pore is defined. With this definition also the local flux $Q_i(p)$ remains constant throughout the pore. 
	\item We can measure the local hydraulic resistance by dividing the total pressure drop by the flux of the pore, and find that it can span approximately two orders of magnitude for the 3 porous media that we have analyzed. 
	\item The definition of the pores allows us to estimate the local hydraulic resistance in terms of the energy/viscous dissipation tensor. This can be modeled by the sphericity of the iso-pressure surfaces and the channelization of the pore, that significantly improves on the Hagen-Poiseuille resistance of pipes. 
	\item One of the key observations of our work is the possibility of introducing a local geometric factor that provides for the ratio of pressure difference and mass flux in a given channel. The factor depends on the considered channel and not the rest of the complicated shape of the medium boundary. The non-triviality of this observation is made transparent by employing the boundary integral representation which is equivalent to the Stokes equations obeyed by the flow. The representation gives the flow as an integral over the medium surface where the points of the surface appear as sources that produce the flow as superposition. The ``charge" of such sources is proportional to the stress tensor at the boundary and the flow that each charge induces in space is given by an appropriate Green's function, see , see e.g. \cite{pozrikidis_boundary_1992}. Our result demonstrates that contributions other than those from the boundary of the considered channel can be neglected in the superposition. The mechanism by which this occurs consists of both screening effect and destructive interference between different channels. It needs further studies which are beyond our scope here.
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Hagen-Poiseuille Flow} 

% For a specific geometry of a pipe with Radius $R$ and length $L$, the second term from Eq.\ref{eq:pressuredrop} of the right-hand-side vanishes by symmetry considerations (i.e. the viscous work is zero). The exact solution for the local velocity can be obtained and is given by 
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:poiseuille}
% v(r)=U \left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2}\right),
% \end{equation}
% with $U$ the maximal velocity. The flux $Q$, pressure gradient and the hydraulic resistance $\mathcal{R}:=\Delta p/Q$ can be simply written by
% \begin{equation}
% 	Q=\frac{\pi R^2 U}{2}\,,\,\frac{\Delta p}{L}=-\frac{4\eta U}{R^2}\, , \, \mathcal{R}_{\rm{hp}}= \frac{\eta L}{\pi^2 R^4}

%
%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  IN-TEXT LISTS

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

% Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
%  will not be numbered, e.g.,:
%  \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

%  Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
%  be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
%  \begin{equation}
%  x^2=y^2 + z^2
%  \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
%   y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
% \end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
